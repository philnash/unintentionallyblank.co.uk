            It seems like a long time since I wrote about
            <a
              href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/10/18/web-accessibility-javascript/"
              >the importance of making websites work without JavaScript</a
            >, a post that uncovered the
            <a href="http://www.nationwide.co.uk"
              >Nationwide building society</a
            >
            locking customers without JavaScript enabled out of their site with
            nothing but a blank page to look at. The post elicited
            <a
              href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/10/18/web-accessibility-javascript/#comment-11751"
              >a response</a
            >
            from <a href="http://accessify.com/">Ian Lloyd</a> from the
            Nationwide web team, saying that they would look into the issue.

            While it has been a long time before I noticed any difference, an
            online banking site can't be changed up that quickly, in the last
            month or so I did notice a difference to the site. Jumping
            immediately to my "disable JavaScript" button I proceeded to try to
            sign on to the online banking section. I was met with a message:
          </p>

          <blockquote cite="https://olb2.nationet.com/default.asp">
            <p>
              Nationwide's Internet Banking requires JavaScript and cookies to
              be enabled. It appears that your browser does not support
              JavaScript, or you have disabled it. Please re-enable JavaScript
              or try accessing this site using a different browser.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            The Nationwide have taken the first step towards accessibility for
            those without JavaScript enabled, a
            <code class="inline">&lt;noscript&gt;</code> element prints out the
            above text. While I don't claim any knowledge of the stringent
            security measures that banks must take, I am still quite sure that
            JavaScript should not be necessary to log on. To make sure of this,
            I checked with my other online bank, the
            <a href="http://www.hsbc.co.uk">HSBC</a>. I was able to log on
            without JavaScript enabled.
          </p>

          <h3>Small Steps</h3>

          <p>
            While a <code class="inline">&lt;noscript&gt;</code> element really
            is the least anyone can do by notifying users that they can't use
            the site without JavaScript, it is a start. As I said above,
            changing an online banking system is not a trivial matter, so I
            appreciate what the Nationwide have done so far. Let's hope that
            this change can inspire further work at the Nationwide, and anywhere
            else where JavaScript is required.
