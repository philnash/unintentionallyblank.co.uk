    <p>It may be belated, but happy new year to all my readers. Even more belated, merry Christmas! I hope you all had a nice holiday season, enjoyed whatever time off you could, got all the presents you wanted, saw all the family you hoped to (or could stand).</p>

<p>I spent the time visiting friends and family, which was lovely. My girlfriend also got me an Xbox 360, which she is probably regretting by now and added to the distractions which have kept me from this blog in the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I enjoyed myself, especially taking a bit of time off from the Internet (but for checking my emails and spam comments from my mobile, which turned out to be invaluable as <a href="http://www.akismet.com">Akismet</a> missed a couple, obviously taking some time off too). It was quite nice to have some time away from a computer, but it is nice to be back too. I return to routine this week, as I am back to work, so I thought I would couple that with a return to the blog too.</p>

<h3>Year In Review - 2007</h3>

<p>2007 was my first full year blogging so it seems right to take a look back over what was popular, how the blog has grown and then have a look forward to the coming year to see where I am going.</p>

<p>I have seen a lot of growth in traffic and subscribers this year. Looking over my stats from January compared to December shows that traffic has increased nearly 250% and subscribers have gone from around 20 to around 120. Over the year I have managed to bring in more than 35,000 page views from more than 23,000 visits, figures that I am very happy with and pleased to say continue to grow.</p>

<p>But enough about my ego, how about the content? The most visited pages this year reflect some of my best posts, which I am happy about. The top 5 is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/05/07/cross-browser-background-transparency-with-css/">Cross Browser Background Transparency With CSS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/09/19/if-internet-explorer-then-do-something-else-a-how-to/">How To Use Conditional Comments In Internet Explorer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/08/18/stylesheet-switcher-part-2/">My Style Sheet Switcher</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/08/14/if-internet-explorer-then-do-something-else">My Opinions On Using Conditional Comments</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/08/02/fontsizing/">My Original Font Sizing Script</a></li>
</ol>

<p>4 out of those 5 are actually posts from 2006 (I suppose established posts tend to get more results from search engines) so if you are relatively new to the blog, please check them out!</p>

<h3>The Year Ahead - 2008</h3>

<p>Having been pleased with the growth above, all I want is more in 2008! This means I will be continuing my series on <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/09/17/web-accessibility-not-just-for-the-blind/">accessibility issues that you may not have thought about</a> and <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/category/tools/">web developer tools</a> as well as more CSS techniques, accessibility issues, scripts and anything else that comes to mind. You may also see a new design soon and I might even upgrade from WordPress 2.2 (yes, I am lazy and haven't upgraded at all recently). As always, if there is something you would like to hear my opinion about or need help with a technique that I have written about (or even those that I haven't, if you want to test me), just <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/contact/">drop me an email</a> or leave a comment below.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and being a part of this blog as we start in 2008. I hope to provide loads of useful stuff, so stick around, but I also hope to make more contacts online, so please say hi whenever you want. Happy new year!</p>
