            A warning, accessibility, while wonderful, is not the be all and end
            all of all things web. Brian Kelly of
            <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/">UK Web Focus</a> made
            that point in a post today using Second Life as an example.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="http://www.secondlife.com">Second Life</a> is a virtual
            world in which residents can walk around and interact with others.
            Being primarily a graphical program, visually impaired users may
            find it difficult or impossible to use. Brian alludes to the idea
            that
            <a
              href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/is-second-life-accessible/"
              >institutions may be developing policies that would prevent use of
              digital resources, like Second Life, because they don't comply
              fully with accessibility guidelines</a
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Just Because Some People Can't Use Something Doesn't Mean No-one
            Should Use It!
          </h3>

          <p>
            While Second Life may not be the ideal application for certain
            users, it can actually enhance the lives of others. The particular
            example Brian points out is Judith, a user suffering with cerebral
            palsy, who uses Second Life. Please see the YouTube clip of an
            interview with Judith below the post (or
            <a
              href="http://uiaccess.com/transcripts/wheeling_in_second_life.html"
              >the transcript of the video here</a
            >). When asked whether she thinks Second Life is a useful tool for
            those who have mobility problems in real life she answers, "Yes,
            because you can have friends without having to go out and physically
            find them".
          </p>

          <p>
            To ban something like this because other users are unable to use it
            to the full potential or, even worse, because it fails to comply
            with accessibility guidelines, is ridiculous. To take another
            example, rich internet applications like
            <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> do not work without
            JavaScript enabled as all the advanced functionality is provided by
            the script. No-one would consider banning Google Docs for not
            catering to those who have JavaScript disabled because the benefit
            to those who can use it far outweighs the downside to those who
            can't.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, we should always attempt to use the technology available
            to make such applications as accessible as possible, the first
            commenter on Brian's post mentions some initiatives to provide
            systems in Second Life for blind users. There is a limit, however,
            and when it is reached an application should be seen for the
            benefits it provides, not the just users it alienates.
          </p>

            Thanks to Brian for the excellent post, the video "Wheeling In
            Second Life" can be viewed below.
