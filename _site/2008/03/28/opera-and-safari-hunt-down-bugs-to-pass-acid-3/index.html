            2008 is turning out to be the year of the browser,

              href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/12/19/holy-standards-support-ie8/"
              >passes the Acid 2 test</a
            >
            (I've seen it do it myself!) and Firefox 3 is in its final beta
            stages (also passing Acid 2) and is
            <a
              href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/03/mozilla-final-v.html"
              >expected to launch in June</a
            >. But this week it is the turn of the smaller, but no less
            important browsers, the generally well behaved, but still with
            single figure percentages in the share of the market, Opera and
            Safari.
          </p>

          <h3>Who Needs Acid 2? We've Got Acid 3!</h3>

          <p>
            Earlier in the week, Safari 3.1 was released bringing web fonts and,
            <a
              href="http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/css_animations_in_safari/"
              >the disputed</a
            >, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> animations. The
            real news, however, is in the nightly builds of both Opera and
            Safari, both of which claimed to have passed the very new
            <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid3/">Acid 3</a> test.
            <a
              href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2008/03/26/opera-and-the-acid3-test"
              >Opera posted first on Wednesday to say that they had passed</a
            >
            with 100/100, but were closely followed by
            <a
              href="http://webkit.org/blog/173/webkit-achieves-acid3-100100-in-public-build/"
              >Safari claiming 100% in Webkit too</a
            >. The only confusion is that to get 100, the Webkit developers
            actually recorded a bug in the test which was
            <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1206578003&amp;count=1"
              >subsequently fixed</a
            >
            before they posted, so maybe Opera only makes 99, we'll have to see.
            My copy of Firefox 2 I'm writing this with made a paltry 53/100, so
            even nearly there is a great achievement.
          </p>

          <h3>Competition Rules When Everyone Competes</h3>

          <p>
            Competition and tests and standards have clearly had Opera and
            Safari developers working incredibly hard to pass Acid 3. If only
            this were true for Mozilla,
            <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=560"
              >who don't seem to believe in it</a
            >. I understand that they are readying a final release and that
            perhaps the intricacies of Acid 3 aren't that important now, but
            <a
              href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2008/03/27/the-missed-opportunity-of-acid-3/"
              >blowing it off entirely</a
            >
            is not the correct attitude (even Microsoft changed their tune about
            Acid 2 from
            <a
              href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/01/31/521344.aspx#521633"
              title="Al Billings' reply from 2006 on criticism of IE7 not passing Acid 2"
              >when they wrote this</a
            >
            to the recent joy of passing).
          </p>

          <p>
            The only sad point is that neither of the two largest browsers are
            focused on Acid 3 at the moment, which means that regardless of all
            the work the Opera and Safari teams have put in, no-one will be able
            to safely use many of the standards, all from prior to 2004 as set
            out by the rules of the test, for longer still.
          </p>

          <h3>Congratulations</h3>

          <p>
            Nothing can be taken away from either of the development teams
            though, congratulations to both Opera and Safari, and here's hoping
            that the other two take notice of these successes and get on with
            supporting these standards too.
