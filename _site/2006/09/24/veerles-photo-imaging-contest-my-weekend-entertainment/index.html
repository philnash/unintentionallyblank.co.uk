            The irresistable urge to take part in competitions run by other
            bloggers has overcome me twice this week. Firstly, I submitted my
            <a
              href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/09/19/if-internet-explorer-then-do-something-else-a-how-to/"
              >how to</a
            >, for the
            <a
              href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/09/18/problogger-group-writing-project-how-to/"
              >ProBlogger group writing project</a
            >
            (look out for another one soon), now I've had a go at
            <a
              href="http://veerle.duoh.com/blog/comments/veerles_photo_imaging_contest/"
              >Veerle's Photo Imaging Contest</a
            >. The idea was simple, Veerle supplied four different pictures of
            herself and all you had to do was manipulate (at least) one of them
            in a creative or witty way. There are prizes on offer, but it is a
            bit of fun too.
          </p>
          <h3>Photo Imaging, Manipulation?</h3>
          <p>
            Yeah, alright, I mainly deal with lines and lines of boring looking
            code, but I have been known to crack out Fireworks and have a go
            with graphics. Anyway, what is better than having some fun with a
            picture of someone else, eh? If you're interested, you can see
            <a
              href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81466434@N00/251588062/in/pool-veerlesphotoimagingcontest/"
              >my attempt on flickr</a
            >
            and if you're really interested, you have until Wednesday to submit
            a picture yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to wish everyone who has taken part so far good luck. I
            have seen some amazing entries and obviously a lot of work in some
            places, as well as some hilarious ideas. Most of the entries are
            also available at the
            <a
              href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/veerlesphotoimagingcontest/pool/"
              >flickr group</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd also like to say thanks to Veerle for running a great
            competition!
