            for the Mac, I noticed a few things missing that I could not use my
            computer without. This in itself is not unusual, but I thought I
            would share my list because the items on it have become such "must
            haves" on my computer that I find myself trying to use them even
            when I'm on someone else's machine. I reckon if I can get so used to
            them, they must be good! Oh, and they're all <em>free</em> too!

            <dd>
              Safe, fast, free, easily extendible, standards compliant and the
              reason Microsoft are worrying about their share of the browser
              market, who wouldn't want to use Firefox to browse the web?

              I've been using Thunderbird for a year and a half now and I seem
              to find a new feature every week! Firstly I just used it to
              replace Outlook Express to read my email, but now it checks for
              junk emails, phishing and scams plus I use it to read my growing
              collection of feeds.

            <dd>
              I never thought I would praise a Microsoft product so heavily, but
              it's on the list. I used to use
              <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html">Spybot</a>
              and <a href="http://www.lavasoft.com">Ad-Aware</a> to keep my
              computer safe from spyware and the like, but since installing
              Defender they haven't had anything to do. Well done Microsoft.

            <dd>
              This has to be the best open source replacement for Notepad, it's
              as fast and unintrusive as the original but includes syntax
              highlighting for many different languages (including web source
              code) and the second most important thing in the world of small
              text editors: line numbers.

              An <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> program that is
              free, fast and simple to use... what more could you want?

            <dd>
              Avast! is free and it keeps my computer safe. I was using Sophos
              as it had been supplied by my university on their network, but
              after changing to Avast! (and nearly destroying my computer; never
              install more than one antivirus at a time) it picked up some
              mistakes that Sophos made and hasn't let me down since.

            <dt><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">iTunes</a></dt>
            <dd>
              I love my music and when it comes to a smooth interface, decent
              copying ability and a place to keep my playlists, I can't find
              anything to beat iTunes. And I don't even have an iPod. Figure
              that out! Other benefits of iTunes include sharing libraries over
              networks, useful if you want to spy on what your friends in your
              halls are listening to.

            <dd>
              I wonder how many people have bought a cheap Dell, like myself,
              and then found out how bad Microsoft Works is. I wonder how many
              of those people were so in need of a decent word
              processor/spreadsheet application that they went and stumped up
              the money for Microsoft Office. I wonder how many of those people
              will kick themselves when they find out that OpenOffice does
              (almost) everything Microsoft Office does (including opening and
              saving to Microsoft formats) for no money at all.

            <dt><a href="http://www.7-zip.org">7-Zip</a></dt>
            <dd>
              Stop WinRar moaning at you to buy it and get 7-Zip instead. It's
              free, it's quick and on top of all the other benefits of open
              source software, it actually compresses files better than WinRar
              or WinZip in their own formats.

            What programs can't you live without? Is there anything here that
            you wouldn't use, and why? Is there any programs you think I should
            add to this? Look out for more posts like this as I take you through
            different sections of my computer/blogging experience that I
            couldn't live without. Maybe you will find something that turns out
            to be invaluable to you too, as I have in my experience. Oh, and
            don't worry, as an ex-student without a job yet, they will all be
            free.
