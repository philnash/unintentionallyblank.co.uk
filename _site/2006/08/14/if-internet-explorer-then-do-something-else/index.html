            I have been working on my first job this week, hence my
            <a
              href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/08/10/how-not-to-blog/"
              >lack of posting</a
            >
            recently. It has been quite an experience finally designing a site
            for someone else, but this is not really the issue on my mind.
          </p>
          <h3>The Box Model Hack Strikes</h3>
          <p>
            The design of the site that I was creating this week prompted me to
            think about support for
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> within
            <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> and the highly documented
            ways to work around it. I was using the CSS from the method for
            <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/footers"
              >sticking a footer to the bottom of a page</a
            >
            from A List Apart and noted the use of Tantek Ã‡elik's
            <a href="http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/boxmodelhack.html"
              >box model hack</a
            >. As I progressed with the design, I came to rest on a fixed width
            layout and deployed the box model hack again. By the time I came
            around to the third use of the hack I had almost forgotten what the
            first two were for and had to read the code carefully to work out
            what I was trying to achieve.
          </p>
          <p>
            "This can't be right, this is my first project and I'm already
            confused," I thought. This reminded me of an article I had read over
            at <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com">Vitamin</a>. Dave Shea
            denounced the use of CSS hacks in his article
            <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/css/stop-css-hacking"
              >Stop Hacking, Or Be Stopped</a
            >
            encouraging the use of Microsoft's proprietary
            <a
              href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp"
              >conditional comments</a
            >. IE7 is coming, hacks will stop working and old and new versions
            of Internet Explorer's mistakes will surface when users make the
            switch to IE7 he said, and I agree, but my perspective on this
            matter is from another step back.
          </p>
          <h3>Clear Code, Clear Mind</h3>
          <p>Why are CSS designers using code that looks like this:</p>
          <pre><code>div.content {
  width:400px;
  voice-family: "\"}\"";
  voice-family:inherit;
  width:300px;
}</code></pre>
          <p>followed by the cutely named, "Be nice to Opera 5" hack:</p>
          <pre><code>html>body .content {
  width:300px;
} </code></pre>
          <p>
            This is hardly elegant, it is confusing and bloats the code. Plus,
            if you design a site using hacks of this variety without commenting
            it heavily and someone else comes along to take over the site, they
            won't know where to begin. In this example we are targetting the
            broken box model of IE5.X, so why not use the following snippet in
            your <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>:
          </p>
          <pre><code>&lt;!--[If IE 5]&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
div.content { width:400px; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;![endif]&#45;&#45;&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>leaving only the line:</p>
          <pre><code>div.content { width:300px; }</code></pre>
          <p>
            in your CSS for all other standards compliant browsers to see? You
            could even put the IE specific code in another stylesheet that only
            IE users would download, rather than taking up space in your HTML.
            I'm sure no-one minds giving IE users a little more to download.
          </p>
          <p>
            So conditional comments target the exact IE version that we need to
            fix, or any range of them, they won't be disappearing, like some of
            the well used hacks, and they even decrease the size of your css
            file (at least to those who have made the jump to a standards
            compliant browser). Finally, they are easy to understand and won't
            confuse anyone in the future who may take over development of the
            site or design in question.
          </p>
          <h3>Other Uses</h3>
          <p>
            Recently an article on
            <a href="http://idealog.us/2006/08/microsoft_drops.html"
              >IE7s non compliance with standards</a
            >
            caught my eye. The author was so taken aback by the lack of
            compliance with the
            <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>'s recommended
            standards that it prompted them to ban IE users from their site
            <a href="http://www.newscloud.com">NewsCloud</a>. The resulting
            uproar caused them to open the site to IE users, but display a
            message to IE users urging them to download Mozilla's Firefox
            instead. A great idea, but the
            <a href="http://www.idealog.us/2006/08/php_browser_det.html"
              >implementation was through
              <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr></a
            >. It seems to me that formulating PHP to do the job was slightly
            wasted when conditional comments are built especially by Microsoft
            for this purpose (alright, they weren't made to encourage users to
            download other browsers, but what an excellent use it is)! All you
            need is:
          </p>
          <pre><code>&lt;!--[If IE]&gt;
Message to IE users
&lt;![endif]&#45;&#45;&gt;</code></pre>
          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            I don't know why Microsoft decided to implement conditional
            comments, but they have their uses in clearing up after the IE
            programming teams mistakes. According to this
            <a
              href="http://www.webdevout.net/browser_support_summary.php?uas=IE6-IE7-FX1_5-OP8-OP9"
              >study of standards support in different browsers</a
            >, IE 6 only supports 51% of the CSS 2.1 standard and IE 7 a mere 4%
            more. However Firefox doesn't cover it all and none of the browsers
            are anywhere near support for CSS 3. I would like to urge the W3C
            and other browser teams to seriously consider adding conditional
            comments to their projects so that the need to hack CSS is
            diminished and the power to develop cross browser sites is given
            back to the designer.
