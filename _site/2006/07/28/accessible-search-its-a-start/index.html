  <div class="content">
    Recently we have seen <a href="http://labs.google.com/accessible/">Google Accessible Search</a> pop up in Google Labs and already there are a bunch of complaints about the search engine giant's latest idea.

Firstly, there have been moans about how the search <em>only</em> caters for those who are blind or visually impaired. This isn't a surprise when one of the research scientists on the Accessible Search team is <a title="T.V. Ramen posts about Accessible Search on the Googleblog." href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/07/finding-easy-to-read-web-content_20.html">blind</a>. However, many of the methods that the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0">WCAG 1.0
</abbr>recommend that target problems that the visually impaired may have remain relevant to those with other disabilities. Thus a search that prioritises those features will benefit other disabled users anyway.

Furthermore, there are some <a title="A quick test of Google's Accessible Search" href="http://www.blether.com/archives/2006/07/google_accessib.php">gripes</a> about the effectiveness of this new type of search. To make matters worse a new adjective, accessoogle, has been <a title="Accessoogle: Definition" href="http://www.etre.com/blog/2006/07/the_definition_of_accessoogle/">swiftly and poorly defined</a>. Accessible Search has only just appeared in Labs, Google's testing ground for new services. This means that it isn't a completed project and there will still be work to be done. Even the <a title="Google Accessible Search FAQ" href="http://labs.google.com/accessible/faq.html">FAQ</a> says "Our methods for identifying accessible pages and content are always evolving".

I, for one, look forward to observing the development of this search from the perspective of someone new to developing accessible websites. It will hopefully encourage more sites to adapt to standards based, accessible design as while the accessible search improves, so will the traffic to accessible sites over their image heavy, tag-soup based siblings. As Google steps into the realm of accessibility, their influence is more than likely to raise the profile of those who work tirelessly and thanklessly for the improvement of accessibility throughout the internet.
One last thing, don't forget that when you search Google for a company name or trademark, you expect to <a title="More complaints about Google's young Accessible Search" href="http://www.researchbuzz.org/wp/2006/07/19/google-now-offering-accessible-search-2/">find what you were looking for</a>, however accessible their website is!
