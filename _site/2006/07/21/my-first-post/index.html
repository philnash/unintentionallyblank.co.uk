        <div class="content">
          Hello. This is my first time blogging, ever. This is my first personal
          site. This is my first time working with
          <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. Essentially this
          post signifies a lot of firsts for me. These firsts may continue for a
          while, I don't know as much about the workings of the internet and
          this is where the blog title has come from. My mind is unintentionally
          blank and I am looking to change that.So, I have decided to start this
          blog as a way of getting my experiences out in the open. I hope that I
          can provide fresh information to some and get feedback from others.
          Some of this will be about myself, as most blogs tend to be, but the
          majority of it will focus on my journey into web standards and
          accessibility, through scripting, and other such important aspects of
          web development, and to where I hope to be in the near future, full of
          experience and ready to get a job in the area that I love: the
          internet and its development. Maybe I should introduce myself quickly.
          I am Phil Nash, I live in Kent in England and I have just finished a
          degree in Maths and Computer Science. You can read more about me on
          the
          <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/about/">about page</a>.
          This site probably has some tweaking still to do, but when is a
          website ever finished? If you have any problems with it, please let me
          know, either through comments or my
          <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/contact/"
            >contact page</a
          >. So, if you are learning how to get along on the web and want to
          join me, then read on. Or, if you are well versed in the ways of the
          web, then maybe you could lend me a helping hand once in a while. I am
          willing to listen ad learn as well as to impart whatever knowledge I
          come across.
