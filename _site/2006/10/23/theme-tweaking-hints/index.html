    <p>I'm busy at the moment, what with <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/10/15/commuting-not-a-way-of-life/">getting to and from work</a> (admittedly taking up most of my time), playing rugby and keeping up with friends, family and eventually sleep. This is my attempt at an explanation for the poor quality of this blog at the moment.</p>
<p>But, I'm not just going to disappear because I run out of hours in the day to do all the stuff I want to. That's one reason why I am posting now, you always have to make time to do things for yourself. I also fixed my stereo earlier, which was of great importance having bought a number of CDs recently and being unable to play them, but that is beside the point.</p>
<p>There is one other reason I haven't turned to typing too much recently. I haven't had this design for three months yet and I'm already busying myself in the background tweaking and turning it into an <em>almost</em> entirely new theme. I've got the bug that <a href="http://nektros.com/2006/10/04/theme-tweakers-arent-the-poor-mans-web-designer/">Yvonne</a> seems to have permanently, and the same headaches that are keeping <a href="http://nyssajbrown.net/blog/2006/10/21/over-tweaking-causes-headaches/">Nyssa</a>  from posting. It is, however, all for fun really. Soon you will see what has been going round my head but failing miserably to transfer to code and screen.</p>
<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>I'm not posting now to hand out hints on tweaking or design (not when my redesign is in the state it's in at the moment), I just wanted to say that there is more than just a change of colour scheme going on here*. There are already signs of what may be happening to my theme that will make it unique to my purposes and I was wondering if anyone had spotted them. Put a little more simply, this isn't just a change in my <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>.</p>
<p>So I ask, what do you think I'm doing to this site? Are there any changes you would make? Maybe I've thought of them, maybe I haven't. Do you like tweaking your theme and do you have any stories of how horribly it broke in Internet Explorer when you checked it out?</p>
<p>My new design will be out soon, it's not done yet, but at least I know what I <em>want</em> it to look like. Oh, and if you think it will look good in the <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/10/19/internet-explorer-7-released/">newly released <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>7</a> first time around, you have to be joking!</p>
<p>* I'm not changing my colour scheme, you've got to think harder than that!</p>
