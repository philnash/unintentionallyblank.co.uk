            The waiting is over for those poor users of Internet Explorer 6 as
            yesterday Microsoft announced that
            <a
              href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx"
              ><abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>7 is now available</a
            >. Go, go and
            <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">download it now</a> and
            experience a safer and better way of surfing the web (with a
            Microsoft product). Then start up Firefox again, because you know
            better.
          </p>
          <h3>Big Changes?</h3>
          <img
            src="http://www.microsoft.com/library/media/1033/windows/ie/images/ie7/home/ie7_thumb_logo.gif"
            width="55"
            height="55"
            alt="IE 7"
            class="alignleft"
          />
          <p>
            IE7 means a few different things; a lot of bug fixes, removal of
            security holes, tabbed browsing, simpler interface, the list is
            probably longer than I'm willing to go on for, I'm not advertising
            it! But more importantly, this could affect any website already on
            the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your site may have looked great in IE6 after tweaking, and possibly
            hacking at it, but I urge you to try it in IE7 now (if you weren't
            already looking with the beta versions). The problem is, the
            rendering has been improved, but it still isn't of the capability of
            proper standards compliant browsers. Add to that the fact that all
            of the famous <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> hacks
            have been removed and any site could look wrong in IE7. My advice
            has always been to
            <a
              href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/08/14/if-internet-explorer-then-do-something-else/"
              >use conditional comments</a
            >
            to keep your site looking good in IE, but I thought I'd warn you
            anyway.
          </p>
          <h3>Automatic Updates</h3>
          <p>
            Not only is IE7 officially with us, but it will be coming in force
            with November. As promised,
            <a
              href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/19/be-ready-for-automatic-update-distribution-of-ie7-by-november-1.aspx"
              >IE7 will be pushed out to users via Automatic Updates</a
            >
            so make sure you're ready!
          </p>
          <h3>My Reaction</h3>
          <p>
            I'm glad that IE7 is now with us, it heralds a new age for web
            development, where Microsoft continue to improve their product
            because both users and developers need the constant improvements.
            Also, the poor guys who use IE because they know no better at least
            get a safer experience and, of course, tabbed browsing. But, there
            is one thing that stands out about this release that impresses me
            more than anything since hearing about the development of IE7. I'll
            leave you with the last paragraph from the announcement of the
            release and hope you'll agree, this is the best thing that Microsoft
            could have said
          </p>

              That said, weâ€™re not done. Even as we put the finishing touches
              on Windows Vista and release all the remaining language versions
              of IE7, we have already started work on the next versions of
              Internet Explorer. Weâ€™ll post more here soon about our plans for
              the product and our plans for listening to you.
