            DJ Sarah Darling will be playing our track Blame in the Xfm Unsigned
            section of the show. You can listen to Blame on the
            <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk/article.asp?id=94145"

            However impartial I would love to be, this is my begging section. I
            hope that you like my band's music, but please vote for them to be
            played again! It will help us no end to reach more music lovers and
            get our music out there. You can listen to more of our music at

              night on Xfm, however it seemed the DJ changed her mind and played
              the unsigned band that were scheduled for Wednesday. Keep
              listening to Xfm all this week to hear HVTS come up and in the
              meantime, you can still
