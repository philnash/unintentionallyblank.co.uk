    <p>This week, I will be mostly looking forward to Wednesday. It's not a particularly special day, it's the last day of the month, it's in the middle of the week and I have nothing special planned. Wednesday is just going to be another normal day at work, another early morning, another commute on the tube, another day in front of a computer, trying to solve problems and help people.</p>

<h3>The Last Day Of The Month</h3>

<p>Oh, I did mention it was the last day of the month, that really can only mean one thing... <strong>payday</strong>!</p>

<p>I wouldn't normally get so excited over a seemingly repetitive, end of month occurrence, but this is January and I am broke.</p>
<p>Did I go over the top in the sales? No.</p>
<p>Did I fail to understand the false sense of security lent to me by an early December paycheck? Yes!</p>
<p>I have made it through the month, and like so many people have done before me, I will breathe a sigh of relief once I have money in my bank. It's like being a student again.</p>

<h3>Any Other Reasons?</h3>

<p>This is not just an ordinary Wednesday, not just an ordinary pay day. No, this Wednesday I finally get connected online in my house! This may not seem like a big deal, but I have been without internet access for 3 months now and anyone who knows me, knows this will have been tough for me. I have struggled through using the internet at work and snatching time at other people's houses, using free wi-fi hotspots, checking emails on my mobile phone and once going to the library.</p>

<p>Finally I will be able to use my own computer to go about my online work. I can release the new design for this blog, I can upgrade to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress 2.1</a>, I can get to work on some of <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/01/01/happy-new-year/">my goals</a> and a whole lot of other things that I planned whilst waiting for this day.</p>

<h3>Big Deal</h3>

<p>I took both of the above for granted over certain periods of my life and this month has been interesting, to say the least. I don't think it is wrong to look forward to the return of two things that are a part of every day for me (especially money, but especially the internet!) and I can guarantee that if you are reading this, you will benefit in some way.</p>
<p>Either I will post more to this blog and you will find out more about me, the way I think and hopefully some interesting bits of code I manage to write, or if I know you in person you may find me more likely to buy you a drink now!</p>
<p>Whatever happens, I'll be happy!</p>
