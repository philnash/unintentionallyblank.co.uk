          <p>
            An argument started up recently regarding the use of actionable
            anchor text for links on a page, or phrases like "Click Here" when
            you want someone to click. It all started with
            <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com">Brian Clark's</a> question,
            <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/click-here/"
              >does telling someone to "click here" actually matter?</a
            >
            It was the following paragraph that made me think about the issue:
          </p>

          <blockquote cite="http://www.copyblogger.com/click-here/">
            <p>
              Another reader once chastised me for wasting anchor text with the
              words â€œclick here,â€ even though my primary goal for the link
              was to get people to click (shocking, I know). This is when I
              first realized that Google is truly making people retarded.
              Somehow, this person no longer saw links as navigation for actual
              people to use; they only exist to pass on â€œjuiceâ€ according to
              an algorithm that no one fully understands.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Does Anyone Else Feel The Argument Got Off On The Wrong Foot?</h3>

          <p>
            Brian was right, search engines shouldn't be telling us how to run
            our websites, however, rather than heading off in the wrong
            direction and maintaining that "Click here" and other similar,
            meaningless phrases are the right thing to do, we should really be
            thinking about what is important: the users.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="http://dmiracle.com">Dawud Miracle</a> highlighted exactly
            the reason
            <a
              href="http://dmiracle.com/better-your-site/using-click-here-is-probably-hurting-your-site/"
              >why "Click Here" should not be used as anchor text</a
            >. Put plainly,
            <strong
              >you cannot tell what a link with the anchor text "Click Here"
              leads to</strong
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>Context Explains The Link</h3>

          <p>
            Some would argue that in a sentence such as, "For more information
            on accessibility, click here," gives context to the link and lets
            users know what to expect when clicking there. But not all users are
            reading everything on the page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Back in 1997, Jakob Nielson tested and wrote about
            <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html"
              >how users read web pages</a
            >, they scan and pick out highlighted phrases, headings and links.
            If you scanned down a page and found the phrase "Click Here"
            highlighted as a link, you would have to stop scanning and read
            around the link to find out what it was about. Or you could just
            click the link to find out,
            <a href="http://green-beast.com/blog/">Mike Cherim</a> alluded to
            this in
            <a
              href="http://accessify.com/news/2007/09/click-here-no-thanks-i-have-a-better-idea/#comment-24320"
              >a comment</a
            >
            on <a href="http://lloydi.com">Ian Lloyd's</a>
            <a
              href="http://accessify.com/news/2007/09/click-here-no-thanks-i-have-a-better-idea/"
              >compromise solution on Accessify</a
            >. Clicking to find out what a link is all about is an untargeted
            click which may have a lower conversion, if you are talking in
            marketing terms. I wonder if Mike has anything that backs up his
            comment.
          </p>

          <h3>How About Accessibility?</h3>

          <p>
            It is always sensible to consult the
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"
              ><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr></a
            >
            when concerning ourselves with the usability and accessibility of
            these choices.
            <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-facilitate-navigation"
              >Point 13.1</a
            >
            says the following:
          </p>

          <blockquote
            cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-facilitate-navigation"
          >
            <p>
              Link text should be meaningful enough to make sense when read out
              of context -- either on its own or as part of a sequence of links.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This is a priority 2 checkpoint, but it deals with the usability
            aspect above as well as assistive technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yucca Korpela has a number of good examples and explanations of
            <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/www/click.html#list"
              >link texts out of context</a
            >, as part of a very good article on not using "Click Here" in
            general.
          </p>

          <h3>Click Here For A Compromise?</h3>

          <p>
            I mentioned a
            <a
              href="http://accessify.com/news/2007/09/click-here-no-thanks-i-have-a-better-idea/"
              >compromise solution on Accessify</a
            >
            earlier, where Ian Lloyd suggested linking a full phrase including
            "Click Here" using a <code class="inline">&lt;span&gt;</code> and
            some <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to emphasise
            the "Click Here" part of the link. This allows for the link to have
            all the information needed to read it out of context, but draws the
            attention of a normal "Click Here". I'm not a fan of this method
            because it still compromises on usability, by making users read
            around the link or click it to find out what it means.
          </p>

          <p>
            I propose a final compromise. Let your link contain all the
            information that you need <em>and</em> use "Click Here". What is
            wrong with saying
            <strong
              >"Continue reading X", "Click Here to subscribe to X" or "Click
              Here to buy to X"</strong
            >? If you look at the
            <a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/barrier.html?ident=30124"
              >phrases that Marketing Sherpa showed were better</a
            >, none of them included "Click Here" for a start, in fact they used
            a little more explanation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ideally, I'd expect more explanation from a link still. You can tell
            your users what to do, but explain where they are going too. Brian
            Clark was right, Google shouldn't matter when thinking of your link
            text, but the accessibility and experience for your users should. As
            Roger Johansson said, almost a year ago,
            <a
              href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200611/click_here_and_other_meaningless_link_phrases/"
              >think before you link</a
            >.
          </p>
