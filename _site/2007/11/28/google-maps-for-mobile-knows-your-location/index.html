    <p>I am a big fan of the mobile web, having just upgraded to <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/11/15/opera-mini-4-released-the-death-of-the-handheld-style-sheet/">Opera Mini 4</a> and been recently quoted in a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/5_essential_mobile_web_apps.php">Read/Write Web article on mobile web apps</a> praising Google Maps for Mobile (yeah, that Phil is me, shame they didn't send me any link love!).</p>

<p>I am actually a big user of both Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/mail/index.html">Gmail for Mobile</a> as well as <a href="http://www.google.com/gmm/index.html">Maps for Mobile</a> and was delighted to hear on the official Google blog that there has been not only an <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/lost-no-found.html">update to Maps for Mobile</a>, but a new <a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/">Google Mobile Blog</a>. While I have subscribed to the mobile blog to keep up with updates to the two programs I mention above, as well as <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/index.html">Android</a>, the new version of Maps had me most excited.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> Without <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr></h3>

<p>The newest feature of Maps, besides seemingly working quicker and with a nicer interface, is the <a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2007/11/new-magical-blue-circle-on-your-map.html"><strong>My Location</strong> feature, a way to tell approximately where you are using mobile tower identification</a>. It's not quite GPS, but for anyone without it, it adds a whole lot more to your phone, without costing you anything extra. If you want to find out more about My Location, read the post and watch the video on the <a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2007/11/new-magical-blue-circle-on-your-map.html">Google Mobile Blog</a>.</p>

<h3>The One Problem With My Location...</h3>

<p>...is that my phone, a Sony Ericsson K800i, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=81871&amp;topic=12595">doesn't support it</a>. (It actually doesn't specifically say on that page that my model doesn't support it, but I pressed 0 a whole load of times and then checked the help in the program and it said "myl: N/A," which really disappointed me.)</p>

<p>I should be getting a new phone soon, so hopefully I will be able to use this feature in the future, but until then, if anyone else uses My Location on Google Maps for Mobile, drop me a comment to tell me what I'm missing out on!</p>

<h3>The Mobile Web Rocks!</h3>

<p>Opera Mini lets me browse like I'm on a fully fledged desktop browser, Gmail gives me my mail, Maps gets me from place to place (I've lived in London a year and I still don't have a clue). Do you use the mobile web at all? Any particular favourite programs or sites? I would love to hear of any experiences you have had with the mobile web, and if you haven't tried it, have a go and let me know what you think.</p>
