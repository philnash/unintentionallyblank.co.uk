        <div class="content">
          <p>
            I am looking to rework a couple of my scripts here at
            Unintentionally Blank as in the time since writing them I have
            learned a lot about accessible, unobtrusive JavaScript. My old
            scripts no longer cut it and it is time to improve them. Before I
            start, I wanted to beat <code class="inline">window.onload</code>,
            the event that tells your JavaScript functions that everything has
            loaded and you can use the
            <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> now. I had heard of
            solutions to this before, but now I was to start developing these
            scripts again I wanted to find the best solution.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Take On <code class="inline">window.onload</code></h3>

          <p>
            Unobtrusive JavaScript relies on externalising all your JavaScript
            code and calling it in via
            <code class="inline">&lt;script&gt;</code> declarations in your
            <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document's
            <code class="inline">&lt;head&gt;</code>. With this method, adding
            functions to elements in the document needs to be done by attaching
            event handlers which classically was done with
            <code class="inline">window.onload</code>. However,
            <code class="inline">window.onload</code> only fires once the
            document and any elements in the document have loaded. So, if you
            have large images or lots of them the
            <code class="inline">window.onload</code> event will not fire until
            everything has loaded. This has the potential of leaving any
            elements you want to give events to go without them, potentially
            allowing users to click on these elements and not receive the
            enhanced behaviour that your JavaScript was just waiting to provide.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beating <code class="inline">window.onload</code> by adding event
            handlers when the DOM, but not necessarily the content and images,
            has loaded reduces this time and quickens the page's response.
          </p>

          <h3>The Solutions</h3>

          <p>
            Looking around the internet threw up a number of increasingly
            complicated solutions.
            <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2005/09/busted/"
              >Dean Edwards seemed to come up with the original solution</a
            >
            which was steadily improved until a
            <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/06/again/"
              >final version as released</a
            >
            (and subsequently used in the
            <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> library, I believe).
            <a href="http://peter.michaux.ca/article/3752"
              >Peter Michaux followed up with some increasingly complicated
              stuff</a
            >
            to remove the time between the page becoming visible and the events
            being attached, but the Dean Edwards method seems to work for most
            applications on a small scale.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following in the footsteps of Dean and packaging the function up
            into a standalone solution was
            <a href="http://www.thefutureoftheweb.com/blog/adddomloadevent"
              >Jesse Skinner with his addDOMLoadEvent</a
            >. Not only did this implement the solution nicely, with all the
            updates that have occurred since the original solving, Jesse also
            compressed the function as best as possible. The current version
            stands at only 671 bytes in size and works in Internet Explorer,
            Firefox, Opera 9 and Safari, plus degrades nicely to use
            <code class="inline">window.onload</code> for any browsers that
            don't support the technique.
          </p>

          <p>
            Coming up soon then, will be the return of my scripts, faster, more
            accessible and generally better than ever before thanks to this and
            other techniques I have picked up over the last year. It will be
            like an early Christmas present, I can't wait!
