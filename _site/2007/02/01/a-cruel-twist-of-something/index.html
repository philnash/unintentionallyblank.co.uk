          <p>
            In a twist of fate, or some other force, this week I have learnt to
            not blog about
            <a
              href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/01/28/oh-happy-day/"
              >things I'm looking forward to</a
            >. Where before it seemed perfectly reasonable to show a bit of
            emotion about my upcoming payday coinciding with getting connected
            to the Internet at home, I couldn't be more wrong!
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm sure stealing some computer time to write about how I won't have
            to steal any more computer time soon is pushing it, but the irony
            rests in fact that I am now borrowing the same Internet connection
            to tell you that I am yet to be connected. I can't complain (sort
            of) because I am getting an incredibly cheap connection from
            <a href="http://www.talktalk.co.uk">TalkTalk</a>. It's just that
            when they wrote to me to say that my go live date was 31st January,
            you can forgive me for believing that I would be online then. What
            they meant, in fact, was that they would send the modem and other
            stuff for getting connected yesterday. I am still going to leave it
            until I am connected before I pass judgement on TalkTalk, but the
            thought of how little it is costing me keeps me going for the
            moment.

          <h3>Posting Whilst At Work?</h3>

          <p>
            So you probably think I am skimping on my job and tending to
            Unintentionally Blank at the moment, but you would be wrong. You
            see, not only am I not online at home yet, I also fell ill
            yesterday. Leaving work early and catching the tube home whilst
            holding back my stomach back was not a pleasant end to the day and
            added to my misfortune, confining my premature excitement to the
            bin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today was spent sitting at home, drinking tea, eating soup and
            watching <a href="http://www.familyguy.com">Family Guy</a>. Not a
            great day. I think I'll go and put the kettle on, sit back in front
            of the television and wait for the modem to drop through my door.
            And just in case my overly excitable post caused yesterday to be
            terrible,
            <em>
              I'm definitely not looking forward to playing a
              <a href="http://ww.hammervsthesnake.co.uk"
                >gig this Saturday</a
              ></em
            >!
          </p>

          <p>Anyway, it wasn't all bad.</p>

          <p>I <em>did</em> get paid!</p>
