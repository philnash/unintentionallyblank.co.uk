          <p>
            Nearly a year ago,
            <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com">MyBlogLog</a> was just another
            way of tracking your blog's stats, boosting your ego by checking
            where your visitors were coming from and where they were going,
            their original selling point. I don't know much about their early
            progress, but after a year
            <a
              href="http://mybloglogb.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/03/mybloglog_turns.html"
              >they had attracted over 13 thousand users</a
            >. More recently
            <a
              href="http://mybloglogb.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/12/the_site_she_gr.html"
              >they posted</a
            >
            how 40 thousand sites had signed up and the numbers signing up per
            day were growing steadily. Then
            <a
              href="http://mybloglogb.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/01/the_jig_is_up_m.html"
              >they were bought</a
            >
            by
            <a
              href="http://yodel.yahoo.com/2007/01/08/bloggers-unite-yahoo-joins-forces-with-mybloglog/"
              >Yahoo</a
            >
            and continue to pop up all over the blogosphere, but what happened
            to this little stat tracking site to cause it's popularity to soar
            recently?
          </p>

          <p>
            You should be able to see the reason MyBlogLog is growing every day
            at the bottom of my sidebar. If you are already a member you will
            know and appear there yourself, as the MyBlogLog Recent Readers
            widget displays who has read this blog recently. Community based
            websites like <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> and
            <a href="http://www.facebook.com">FaceBook</a> have prospered
            unimaginably due to their members' ability to network with each
            other, but in the world of
            <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> or other hosted
            blog platforms the premise falls apart somewhat. Bloggers build up a
            community through comments and commenting on others, but that's it
            (save for staring endlessly at your own stats on Google Analytics
            and wondering, or trying to imagine what type of person uses
            <a
              href="http://www.snarfware.com/"
              title="I don't know, I just picked a random one"
              >Snarfer</a
            >
            as a feed reader whilst browsing Feedburner subscribers).
          </p>

          <h3>Bring The Community To The Blog</h3>

          <p>
            That's why MyBlogLog's simple idea has impressed me and countless
            others. Now you, and your readers, can see who else is reading your
            blog. And you can see what other blogs they are reading, whilst they
            see what blogs you are reading. And you can become friends. And you
            can build a
            <a
              href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/unintentionallyblank/"
              >community</a
            >
            together. And you can see what your community are visiting. And the
            list goes on...
          </p>

          <p>
            The Recent Readers widget is a web 2.0 dream come true that puts the
            power in the hands of bloggers (you can even style it to match your
            website using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, but
            more on that in a later post). It is the personal element that web
            2.0 desires, built on top of blogging's already strong foundation
            with the addition of being available anywhere. It makes the internet
            itself the social tool rather than pre-designated social sites like
            MySpace, and because it offers this freedom it is growing fast. I
            hope it continues to grow this way as the more people using it, the
            more I am able to discover who reads my blog and the more blogs I
            will be able to discover through the people who read my blog.
          </p>

          <h3>Anything Else?</h3>

          <p>
            Next up is the
            <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/cobrand_join.php"
              >Co-branded communities</a
            >
            which puts even more power into the blogger's hand. It's in alpha
            testing right now, so I can only stare longingly at
            <a href="http://community.techcrunch.com/"
              >TechCrunch's integrated community</a
            >! Still, it proves there is more to come from an already incredible
            service.
          </p>

            people's blogs in the widget or even next to your comments if they
            use the
