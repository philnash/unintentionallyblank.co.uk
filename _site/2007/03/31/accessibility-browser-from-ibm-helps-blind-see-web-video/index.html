            According to the BBC,
            <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6507189.stm"
              >IBM are set to release a web browser specifically for blind and
              partially sighted users</a
            >. The aim of the Accessibility Browser is to give access to and
            control over multimedia content embedded in websites to those who
            can't use a mouse for browsing.
          </p>

          <blockquote cite="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6507189.stm">
            <p>
              Screen readers and self-talking browsers are not able to deal with
              video and animation, some of which starts playing as soon as a
              page is loaded.
            </p>

            <p>
              This often interferes with the synthesised speech output from the
              screen-reader software.
            </p>

            <p>
              Using the A-Browser, a vision-impaired person can control media
              content by using predefined shortcut keys, rather than having to
              look for the control buttons using a mouse.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            With the success of multimedia sites such as
            <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> and
            <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> it is great that there
            will be a browser that will allow control over the multimedia
            elements of the page. I can personally vouch for the fact that
            MySpace music pages annoy me by playing music instantly. Imagine the
            difficulty of dealing with that when you're trying to hear the text
            on the rest of the page. At the moment IBM are concentrating on
            content compatible with Windows Media Player and Real Player, we can
            hope that they are able to tackle Flash media players in the future
            too.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would be interested to learn how this technology will work with
            the web at the moment, how much it will rely on following of current
            web and accessibility standards. It is definitely destined to extend
            the ability of blind and partially sighted users to use the
            Internet, which is a great development for the reported 160 million
            this could benefit. Good luck to IBM with this initiative.
          </p>
