            Last week,
            <a
              href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/03/personality-goes-long-way.html"
              >Google announced themes for their personalised homepage</a
            >. I love using the personal homepage and thought this was an
            innovative and endearing idea, even though it is quite a move from
            Google's standard stark white background. My one problem was that I
            couldn't use it to start with.
          </p>

          <h3>What Themes?</h3>

          <p>
            A lot of
            <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-03-20-n28.html"
              >places</a
            >
            <a
              href="http://lifehacker.com/software/google-homepage/customize-your-google-homepage-with-themes-245471.php"
              >mentioned</a
            >
            the
            <a
              href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/03/themes-for-google-personalized-homepage.html"
              >new themes</a
            >, with special mention to Tony Ruscoe for
            <a
              href="http://ruscoe.net/blog/2007/03/google-personalized-homepage-easter.asp"
              >finding some of the Easter Eggs already</a
            >, but, as the image below shows, there was no indication how to add
            a theme to the page.
          </p>

          <img
            src="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/personalised.gif"
            alt="Google Personalised Homepage"
            class="alignleft"
          />

          <p>
            I returned to
            <a
              href="http://tech-buzz.net/2007/03/21/google-personalized-homepage-gets-themes/"
              >Tech Buzz</a
            >, where I originally read the story, read it all again, clicked on
            the link to Google and found the select theme link instantly.
          </p>
          <img
            src="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/select-theme.gif"
            alt="The select theme link appeared."
            class="alignright"
          />

          <h3>The Difference?</h3>

          <p>
            My bookmarks were previously set to
            <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/ig">http://www.google.co.uk/ig</a>,
            but clicking on the link from the Tech Buzz article took me to
            <a href="http://www.google.com/ig"
              >http://www.google.<strong>com</strong>/ig</a
            >. It seems that google.co.uk doesn't allow themes yet, but
            google.com does. It doesn't make much difference, all I have to do
            is change my bookmarks, but it does mean that I lose the ability to
            search sites from just the UK from my homepage. Still, if you use
            google.co.uk, but want to see their new themes you will have to do
            this for now.
          </p>

          <h3>The Only Difference?</h3>

          <p>
            Apart from themes, I have also found that the
            <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/render">Google Calendar</a>
            widget works much better on google.com, highlighting days with
            events on and displaying your agenda as well as allowing you to add
            events, seemingly the only feature on the google.co.uk incarnation.
            If you use google.co.uk have you noticed these or any other
            differences? Is the better functionality of google.com enough to get
            you to change your bookmark/homepage?
