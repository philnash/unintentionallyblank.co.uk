            I have had a <em>busy</em> week. It started last Thursday with a
            meal and more than a few with my work colleagues. Friday morning
            wasn't too pretty, but I struggled through the day in order to
            attend a stag do I had been organising for my friend. Saturday was
            spent paintballing, watching
            <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6454287.stm"
              >the agonising end of the six nations</a
            >
            and continuing to drink our stag into the ground. Sunday was a day
            for rest, relaxation and, mainly, rehydration. I've been back to
            work this week and spending my evenings looking after a sick
            girlfriend and babysitting next door's, also ill, children.
          </p>

            So what do you do when you run out of time to blog? It's taken me
            until today to catch up with all the articles in my
            <a href="http://reader.google.com">feed reader</a> and I am
            exhausted (I'll be in bed merely seconds after hitting the publish
            button, I promise). Do you always make sure you have a post or two
            saved up? Do you concentrate more on quick links or news stories if
            you don't have much time? I need to learn how to keep up when
            everything else seems to take over, if you can help I'd love to hear
            from you.
