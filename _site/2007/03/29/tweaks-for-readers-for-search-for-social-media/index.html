          <p>
            You may have noticed that I've spent a bit of time over the last
            couple of days tweaking my design a bit. Some of this tweaking was
            to make the design a bit more readable, some of it was to help out
            the search engines in deciding what each page on this site was about
            and finally I made a change to make it easier to submit my articles
            to any social bookmarking or social media sites. Some changes you
            will have noticed, others might slip by you and some you will only
            have got if you regularly view the source of the different pages on
            this site.
          </p>

          <h3>Changes You'll Notice</h3>

          <p>
            First up I've adjusted some of the spacing on the front page,
            particularly down the bottom of the page. It all looked a bit too
            spaced out before and now things are held in a little more organised
            way. I have also increased the text size. 10 pixels looks nice, but
            I'd rather people could read the text I've written without straining
            themselves. This was a silly point that I overlooked when
            redesigning and should have been thought about more carefully. I
            have also increased the size of the lower headings on the front
            page, changed my footer and created an entirely new
            <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/about/">about</a>
            page, including a picture too! The old about page didn't really fit
            the direction I was going with the blog, so I thought a change of
            content and a change of style were needed.
          </p>

          <h3>Ad Free Front Page</h3>

          <p>
            If you check
            <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk">the front page</a>
            you will find no more adverts. I'm trying out
            <a
              href="http://casualkeystrokes.com/my-adsense-tip-for-personal-blogs/"
              >Char's tip</a
            >
            for three reasons. Firstly, to try and serve more relevant ads on
            each post page as Char has found out that the ads seem to be more
            targeted since making the change. Secondly, to decrease the time it
            takes to load the front page to give a swift response to anyone who
            comes to the front page and lastly to make a good impression; some
            people don't like adverts on a blog, they are a necessary evil at
            times just to try and balance the cost of blogging out, but I don't
            want to put people off instantly either. I will let you know if this
            makes a difference in the long run.
          </p>

          <h3>Give The Search Bots Something</h3>

          <p>
            For a start I've added a bit extra to my page title. On the front
            page I have the name of the blog and a tagline (with a few keywords
            that I'd like to associate with the site). On any post pages I have
            the title of the post followed by the blog name. The title is one of
            the most important elements on a page for search engines, so putting
            a bit more effort and a bit more information into each one gives you
            a step up in the search engines.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, in order to really make all the crawler bots feel at home, I
            have re-aligned a couple of my heading elements. A post on
            <a
              href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/03/05/wp-seo-tips-tag-youre-it/"
              >Wordpress
              <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> tips</a
            >
            at Weblog Tools Collection got me thinking about my
            <code class="inline">&lt;h1&gt;</code>s and my
            <code class="inline">&lt;h2&gt;</code>s. Now, the top heading (<code
              class="inline"
              >&lt;h1&gt;</code
            >) on my front page is the name of the blog as that is the most
            iimportant name to get across on the front page, the main post title
            is an <code class="inline">&lt;h2&gt;</code> and subsequent post
            titles are <code class="inline">&lt;h3&gt;</code>s. On a post page,
            the <code class="inline">&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the post title, in
            this case the most important title on the page. The name of the blog
            is then demoted to <code class="inline">&lt;h2&gt;</code>; still
            important, but not as much as the real content of the page. This
            took a few tweaks to my theme, so let me know if you want to know
            how.
          </p>

          <h3>Social Optimisation</h3>

          <p>
            I used to have a <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> and a
            <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> link at the bottom of each
            post. Now I have replaced that with more social links that take up
            less space! I like to see when something gains in popularity because
            it's a good idea and that is exactly what is happening with
            <a
              href="http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/readme?project=share-this"
              >Alex King's Share This plugin</a
            >
            (and the
            <a href="http://alexking.org/projects/share-icon"
              >Share icon project</a
            >). I have decided to implement it here to add options to anyone who
            really appreciates my posts and to clean up the information at the
            bottom of the posts. I had to hack at it a bit to get it to fit in
            with the rest of the site, so have a click and at least tell me the
            colours look nice!
          </p>

          <h3>I Love Tweaking</h3>

          <p>
            So that's most of what's changed around here in the last couple of
            days. Do you find the urge to tweak your blog unresistable too? Do
            you like the changes I have made? Do you have any suggestions that I
            could try next time I come to tweak? You know what to do.
