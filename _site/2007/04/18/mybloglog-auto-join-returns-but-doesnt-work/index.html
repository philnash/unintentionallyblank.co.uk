          <h3>It Half Works</h3>

          <p>
            I received an email notification this morning that I had auto joined
            two communities, <a href="http://momgadget.com">Momgadget</a> and
            <a href="http://thewrongadvices.com/">The Wrong Advices</a>. Sure
            enough, they both show up in
            <a
              href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/philnash/communities/"
              >my communities</a
            >, but there is no sign of me in
            <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/momgadget/"
              >their</a
            >
            <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/TheWrongAdvices/"
              >communities</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            I appreciate that there is a lot to be done, sorting spam, moving to
            Yahoo, etc. and I am glad that things are moving forward. I was
            particularly happy when they put a few more measures in to
            <a
              href="http://mybloglogb.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/04/mybloglog_is_re.html"
              >stop gaming MyBlogLog</a
            >. I was just sad to see that a previously active feature has been
            announced again and doesn't work.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong
              >Come on MyBlogLog, I like the service, keep up the good work and
              sort this out!</strong
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            In other news, I will be finishing the second part of
            <a
              href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/03/06/making-mybloglog-pretty-how-to-style-the-recent-readers-widget/"

            soon, but everything is busy, busy, busy at the minute!

          <ins style="text-decoration: none; font-style: italic"
            >Edit: It seems to have worked now, I am now a member of both the
            communities I mention. I wonder if there is a time delay on
            appearing in your communities that you auto joined or if it was a
            bug that the team have quickly ironed out. Either way, I'm glad to
            see it's working now!</ins
