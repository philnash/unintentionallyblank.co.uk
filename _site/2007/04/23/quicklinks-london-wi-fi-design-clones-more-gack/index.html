<dt>Today <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6577307.stm">the City of London unveiled it's wi-fi network</a>.</dt>
<dd>The mesh network covers 95% of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">City of London</a> to provide wi-fi access to 350,000 people. There's only one problem, <em>it's not free</em>! It is, however, a step in the right direction for the <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/11/19/the-campaign-for-free-wi-fi/">free wi-fi that we all hope for</a>. It can't be long, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5297884.stm">Norwich has it</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6199382.stm">Manchester are planning it</a>, I only wonder what the likelihood of a free service is when paid versions are sprouting up now. At least here the first month is free, I might take my laptop to work this week. Then again, I might just stay at my desk at lunchtime and use the Internet there!</dd>
<dt>Andy Rutledge takes <a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/stepford-wives.php">a look at a few similar looking sites</a>.</dt>
<dd>You would have thought that the marketing arms of each of the featured clones would have noticed that their sites were almost identical to their competitors. Then again, maybe they haven't changed out of admiration for each other's design ability. Whichever is true, I would like to see the result if one, like Andy suggests, steps out of line and makes for some originality. Andy only picked up on American department stores, but check out <a href="http://www.next.co.uk/">Next</a>, <a href="http://www.debenhams.com">Debenhams</a>, <a href="http://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/">House of Fraser</a> and <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/default.aspx?source=21977">John Lewis</a>. Again, like Andy suggests, take a logo and put it on another site. You couldn't tell the difference!</dd>
<dt>Once more, <a href="http://gackink.com/2007/04/23/round-three-submissions-now-open/">Gack Ink is open for submissions</a>.</dt>
<dd>The little Bring Your Own Blog network is growing in both numbers and personality. Get on board now.</dd>
