    <p><img src="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/survey-logo.gif" alt="The Web Design Survey" class="alignleft" />I did not complete the 36 questions posed by <a href="http://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> in the first <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/webdesignsurvey">Web Design survey</a>. While I considered it and even started it once, I didn't finish it. I wanted to, but I wouldn't have felt right if I had.</p>

<p>Why not? Because I am not a designer, developer, project manager, writer, editor, information architect or usability specialist... yet. In fact, there was absolutely no mention of support desk worker for an implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_AG">SAP HR</a> or <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> analyst, as I like to call myself, though I can't say I'm surprised!</p>

<p>Web development is currently a hobby for me, a past-time I really enjoy. Creating my own sites or code is great as is helping other people too. Blogging sits on top of that as a way of interacting, getting my code, my thoughts, my opinions out there for anyone to read and it drives me on. Nothing drives me as much as the thought of working and being a true part of this profession though and the positive feedback and growing traffic I am receiving here serves to boost me everyday.</p>

<p>I am in the market for a new job now, if you have any tips on getting into web development professionally, I would love to hear from you. I've had a couple of interviews so far and things are going reasonably well, but every little helps.</p>

<p>Who knows (and I'm keeping my fingers crossed), this time next year maybe I will be taking the survey. In the meantime, I eagerly await the results to see what sort of an industry I am trying to get into.</p>
