            I am going to upgrade my computer. My current PC isn't the flashiest
            box out there at the moment, in fact, with a Celeron processor and
            256<abbr title="Mega Bytes">MB</abbr> of
            <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> it's pretty sluggish.
            I am due an upgrade.
          </p>

          <p>
            What's with the title then? Well I have been considering my options
            for this upgrade and I am leaning towards the idea of getting a Mac.
            I was hoping you could help though. I've never had a Mac and I have
            never seriously used one (wandering into the Apple Store and playing
            about on one doesn't count). I have always used PCs (except for my
            <em>old</em> Amiga 500, those were the days) and need some help
            deciding what is right for me.
          </p>

          <h3>Can You Help?</h3>

          <p>
            Do you have experience, good or bad, with Macs? Can you tell me why
            I should be getting one? Can you tell me why I shouldn't, why I
            should stick with a trusty PC?
          </p>

          <p>
            I like coding and making websites, listening to music and surfing
            the web. My girlfriend loves uploading digital photos. Should we
            stick with what we know or change things up a bit?
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them. I'm a little
            confused right now as I try to justify spending almost double on an
            Apple over a PC. I hope you can help me out, or at least point me in
            the right direction.
          </p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
