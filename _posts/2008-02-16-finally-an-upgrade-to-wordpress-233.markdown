<p>It has finally happened, I got over myself and upgraded my old, so very old, version 2.2 WordPress. The longer it got, the more I didn't want to do it, but as the days ticked over on my dashboard since the last release and talk of the upcoming version 2.5 started, I decided that I had to bite the bullet and just do it.</p>

<p>So I started myself a test server on my home desktop, installed WordPress 2.2, imported my blog and my theme and did a test run. This seemed to go well. Then I backed everything up, twice. Finally, after waiting and biting my nails for a couple of days, I went for it and now you can see the result. My theme works, I imported tags from Ultimate Tag Warrior and they seem to have worked, I upgraded a bunch of plugins and they seemed to work. Everything was happy.</p>

<p>Then I went to write a post and panicked! I knew that in the database some tables had changed, but when I got a message telling me, "[Table 'wordpress.wp_post2cat' doesn't exist]" I scared myself and started thinking about all those backups I made. Thankfully <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/135564">this support thread</a> helped me out straight away, since it turns out I hadn't upgraded enough plugins.</p>

<p>If you do see any strange behaviour from this blog, do please <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/contact/">let me know</a> so that I can sort it as soon as possible. In the meantime you can carry on looking forward to an upcoming redesign to go with the new version, including tags and everything available with my new WordPress 2.3.3.</p>
