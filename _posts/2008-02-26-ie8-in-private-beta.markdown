<p>Quick bit of news today, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1214">Internet Explorer 8 beta 1</a> has been released to a <a href="http://www.activewin.com/awin/comments.asp?HeadlineIndex=42767">select few</a> for testing. I wonder whether, as some suggested, the version targeting has been left out at this stage. Then again, I also wonder what it looks like, what it feels like to use, how much of an improvement it is in terms of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript and how much better it is than IE7. I would love to have an early look! Apparently there will be a public beta soon and we can look forward to demonstrations at the upcoming <a href="http://visitmix.com/2008/default.aspx">Mix 08</a>, but who wants to wait?</p>

<p>So, if anyone's listening in Microsoft, I'd love to see your new browser!</p>
