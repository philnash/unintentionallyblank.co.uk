<p>Hans at <a href="http://blogosquare.com">Blogosquare</a> is running a competition that allows you to show off your own themes or templates that you have designed and, if you top the voting at the end of the competition, a great prize. The prizes avaliable are:</p>

<ol><li>1 year hosting and a .com domain name as well as a review by <a href="http://www.techzonline.net/2007/04/04/blogosquarecom-design-competition/">TechZonline</a></li>

</ol>
<p>If you want to enter, visit the <a href="http://blogosquare.com/2007/04/03/blogosquare-themestemplates-design-competition/">competition page</a> to find out how.</p>

<p>If you don't want to enter, <a href="http://blogosquare.com/2007/04/03/blogosquare-themestemplates-design-competition/">visit anyway</a> and rate the designs that have been entered. I put in the design for this blog, so if you like it I would really appreciate a few extra votes in the competition.</p>

<p>Good luck to everyone else that has added their designs for the competition too.</p>
