<p><a href="http://www.gackink.com">Gack Ink</a>, the "bring your own blog" network, is having it's <a href="http://gackink.com/2007/03/01/round-two-submissions-now-open/">second round of submissions</a>. You have until 8am <abbr title="Eastern Standard Time">EST</abbr> (whatever that is compared to your time, I certainly don't know) Monday morning (or afternoon/Sunday evening depending on your time zone). So head on over, check out how to apply and have a go!</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I have finally added the Gack Ink button to my sidebar. I'm not sure how well it fits with the rest of the site though. I wonder if I'll be able to design my own button/link? The main point is, click through and check out the other members of the network, I have found a ton of new stuff to read and I am more than looking forward to discovering the new round admissions. Will you be among them?</p>

<h3>Wordpress 2.1.1 is Dangerous</h3>

<p>It was quite a surprise to see that the <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> development blog were declaring that their latest release was dangerous. Turns out someone was messing with the original code of our beloved blogging software. Thank goodness for the swift work and dedication of the Wordpress team in providing a newer version. If you installed version 2.1.1 (unlike me, I'm just too lazy) then <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/03/upgrade-212/">download 2.1.2 <em>now</em></a>!</p>
