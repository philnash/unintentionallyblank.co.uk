<p>Thanks very much to Mostafa Mourad, a 27 year old web designer who recently discovered he was colour blind. People who are colour blind have different needs to most users of the internet, just as blind people do, but this thoughtful post seeks to enlighten the rest of us somewhat in the <a href="http://spellcoder.com/blogs/mostafa/archive/2006/08/20/317.aspx">way that colour blind people see the world</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know for a link it's taken me a while to post it, but it's here to remind me as much as it is to show anyone else who hasn't seen it too.</p>
