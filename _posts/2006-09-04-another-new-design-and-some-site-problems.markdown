<p>I have been meaning to create a new design for this blog, to accompany the stylesheet switcher, for quite a while and today I finally got round to it. If you select "Tentacles" (the jury is still out on the name), you will see my latest design. It shows what can be accomplished with different stylesheets and the same basic content, plus has given me practice working with transparent <abbr title="Portable Network Graphic">png</abbr>s, fixed width designs, absolutely and relativley positioned divs and z-indexes. I think it turned out rather well, what do you think?</p>
<p>Also, it has come to my attention that there are problems using both comments and my contact form. It seems that the contact form is completely broken, so please don't use it. If you have to get in touch with me, please email me using my real address. So that the address hungry spam harvesters don't steal my address I'll give you some clues instead. My name is phil, my address is at this url. Get it? Great.</p>
<p>With regards to the comment problem, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/23942">here is an explanation of the problem</a> and (probably) why it is occuring. If you want to leave a comment, please try to do so first, if you receive an error message then have a look at the Wordpress support and see if you can fix it.</p>

<p>Finally, I am off for a week on holiday to France. I will be unable to keep up to date with your comments, but I will respond as soon as I can when I return next Tuesday. In the meantime, I hope you keep well. If there are any other problems with my site/new design that I haven't noticed please let me know. Au revoir!</p>
