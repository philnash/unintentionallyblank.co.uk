<p>100 posts: a milestone, a turning point, a celebration.</p>

<p>It has taken a while though hasn't it!</p>

<p>This blog, though only just reaching the century has been with me on quite a journey. I finished university at the start of last summer and <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/07/21/my-first-post/">started this blog</a> in July 2006. Since then I <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/09/30/out-of-the-blue-a-job/">got a job</a>, moved to London, went <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/11/11/quick-update/">without the internet</a> for a number of weeks, returned with a <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/02/09/redesign-what-do-you-think/">site redesign</a>, joined a <a href="http://www.gackink.com">blog network</a> and <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/07/03/the-end-of-one-good-thing-and-the-start-of-something-really-special/">got another job</a>.</p>

<h3>A Busy Year</h3>

<p>So yes, it has been a busy year, full of sporadic posting and new things in the real world. So 100 posts, a long term job and some stability seem to combine now and make it time to re-evaluate.</p>

<h3>This Sounds Serious</h3>

<p>It <em>is</em> serious, but not in a bad way. In fact, I am quite excited! Unintentionally Blank has a lot of go in it, I have plans for posts (not something that happens every day), and I am gaining experience in my job every day. However, I also don't want to spend all my time writing about the web, however much I enjoy it. There have been times in the last year where I have gone off on tangents and I want more of it!</p>

<p>So, I have decided that Unintentionally Blank will remain my web development blog, and only web development. I will post a, hopefully, steady stream of articles and opinions on developing for the web. But what about the tangents and the off topic stuff? For that, I have a new blog, <a href="http://www.philnash.co.uk">Everything Must Go</a>, a place that I can talk about anything, and I hope you'll join me.</p>

<p>Thank you for sticking with me this far, now it's time for me to step it up a gear!</p>
