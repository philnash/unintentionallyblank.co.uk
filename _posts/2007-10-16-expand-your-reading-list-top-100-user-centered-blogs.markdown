<p>If you are interested in web design and development (I'm hoping this is the case anyway, otherwise I'm doing something wrong!) you definitely want to check out this list of the <a href="http://www.virtualhosting.com/blog/2007/top-100-user-centered-blogs/">Top 100 User Centered Blogs</a> by the Virtual Hosting Blog. There are some top names on the list that everyone has heard about as well as many other passionate writers about subjects including accessibility, usability, design and web standards.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I am very touched to have been included on the list, but I also think that the list could be a very good starting point for anyone wanting to learn more about the important side of design for the web: the users. I will be going through the list myself, inevitably picking up a lot of knowledge from the wealth of great bloggers/developers available. Let me know of any gems that you find.</p>
