<p>It's nice to know that life has a knack of knowing when to take you down a notch. Sure, I got <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2008/04/02/fresh-beginnings/">a new job</a> that's just around the corner, traffic here is at the best it's been and my rugby team were playing for the league title at the weekend, what could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>Maybe I gave you a hint by mentioning the rugby, there is good and bad news. We won the game, we won the league. The bad news: I only played 10 minutes due to a misplaced tackle that caused me to twist my ankle in several wrong directions. A swollen leg, a trip to the hospital (my first time in an ambulance) and several hours later left me with a cast and still no concrete knowledge of what the real problem was. You see it is entirely possible, according to half the x-rays and half the doctors, that I had broken bones they had never seen broken before, everyone else said it was a nasty sprain.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like my short walk to work has become even shorter as working from home outweighs the long journey on crutches.</p>

<p>I hope you had a good weekend, I spent mine getting plastered.</p>
