<p>This year, April 9th is that time of year again. The time when you say, who needs <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>? Who needs fancy design at all? Who needs anything more than clean, semantic <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to present information to the web?</p>

<p>April 9th is <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day</a>, brainchild of <a href="http://www.dustindiaz.com/naked-08/">Dustin Diaz</a> and the single reason that within the last month I received hits to <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/04/02/stripping-off-for-web-standards-its-naked-day/">last year's announcement</a> from searches such as "<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=stripping+on+the+web">stripping on the web</a>", "<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=naked+forever">naked forever</a>" and "<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=proud+to+be+naked&amp;start=10">proud to be naked</a>". Bonus search results aside, the day is meant to show that well marked up HTML content is readable, accessible and essential as the base for any site.</p>

<p>Do you have the markup to take part? Lose your CSS for web standards, next week!</p>
