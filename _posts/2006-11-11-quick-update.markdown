<p>Life is new and exciting at the moment, I have a new house, a reasonably new job, money and a new design coming. My one problem is that I don't have internet access. I am 95% finished with my new design (which is <em>hot</em> by the way) and I can't upload it to test. I have ideas for posts bubbling inside of me, but I don't get any time with a computer to set them free. I can just about manage to comment on some of my favourite blogs whilst I am at work, but I feel as though people are watching me even though I am on lunch break.</p>
<p>So don't worry, as soon as my internet connection is re-established, I will back into the blogosphere like a writer possessed. I have so many things to say and once I get back at it, you won't be able to stop me. Hang around, I will be back in touch soon.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you have been visiting and disappointed by any lack of updates, thanks for dropping by and don't give up on me!</p>
