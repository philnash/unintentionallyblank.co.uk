<p>It's always interesting to see what plugins other WordPress bloggers use. Today <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/09/30/which-wordpress-plugins-do-you-use/">Darren Rowse shared a few of his favourites</a>. As it's the weekend I thought I'd show you my top plugins too.</p>



<h3>Spam Control</h3>
<ul><li><a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>. Of course.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/">Bad Behaviour</a>. For killing bots at source.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feed Control</h3>
<ul><li><a href="http://cavemonkey50.com/code/full-feed/">Full Text Feed</a>. No-one likes partial feeds, just cause I use the more tag every now and again doesn't mean my subscribers have to suffer.</li>
<li><a href="http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-better-feed-rss/">Better Feed</a>. To add stuff to my feed, probably needs clearing up though.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For The Comments</h3>
<ul><li><a href="http://kimmo.suominen.com/sw/dofollow/">DoFollow</a>. Feel the link love.</li>
<li><a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/LiveCommentPreview">Live Comment Preview</a>. See what your comment will look like, before you've even written it.</li>
<li><a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe to comments</a>. So you can keep in touch with your comments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Post Level Plugins</h3>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.w-a-s-a-b-i.com/archives/2006/02/02/wordpress-related-entries-20/">Related Posts</a>. In case you want to read more.</li>
<li><a href="http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress">Share This</a>. In case you want to Digg, or del.icio.us or Stumble or several other options.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viewfinderdesign.co.uk/archive/category/downloads/">More Tag Modifier</a>. For slipping ads into the middle of posts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul><li><a href="http://meidell.dk/archives/category/wordpress/latest-comments/">Brian's Latest Comments</a>. To see where the action is.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/secure-form-mailer-plugin-for-wordpress/">Dagon Design Form Mailer</a>. Safe and secure contact form.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2005/06/05/google-sitemaps-generator-v2-final">Sitemap generator</a>. Give Google your sitemap and get crawled.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple of others, but I hardly use them. I'd have to say the above are my favourites. Maybe I use too many, maybe not enough. I would like to extend a huge thank you to all those who write and update theses plugins for nothing, without them our blogs would be a much more boring place (full of comment spam for one thing!).</p>

<h3>You've Seen Mine, Let's See Yours</h3>

<p>Why don't you share your favourite plugins too? I am always interested in seeing how other people run their blogs and whether I'm missing out on a vital plugin. Let me know if you see any here that catch your eye too.</p>
