<p>I have had a <em>busy</em> week. It started last Thursday with a meal and more than a few with my work colleagues. Friday morning wasn't too pretty, but I struggled through the day in order to attend a stag do I had been organising for my friend. Saturday was spent paintballing, watching <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6454287.stm">the agonising end of the six nations</a> and continuing to drink our stag into the ground. Sunday was a day for rest, relaxation and, mainly, rehydration. I've been back to work this week and spending my evenings looking after a sick girlfriend and babysitting next door's, also ill, children.</p>

<p>So what do you do when you run out of time to blog? It's taken me until today to catch up with all the articles in my <a href="http://reader.google.com">feed reader</a> and I am exhausted (I'll be in bed merely seconds after hitting the publish button, I promise). Do you always make sure you have a post or two saved up? Do you concentrate more on quick links or news stories if you don't have much time? I need to learn how to keep up when everything else seems to take over, if you can help I'd love to hear from you.</p>
