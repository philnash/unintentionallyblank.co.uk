<p>In a twist of fate, or some other force, this week I have learnt to not blog about <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/01/28/oh-happy-day/">things I'm looking forward to</a>. Where before it seemed perfectly reasonable to show a bit of emotion about my upcoming payday coinciding with getting connected to the Internet at home, I couldn't be more wrong!</p>

<p>I'm sure stealing some computer time to write about how I won't have to steal any more computer time soon is pushing it, but the irony rests in fact that I am now borrowing the same Internet connection to tell you that I am yet to be connected. I can't complain (sort of) because I am getting an incredibly cheap connection from <a href="http://www.talktalk.co.uk">TalkTalk</a>. It's just that when they wrote to me to say that my go live date was 31st January, you can forgive me for believing that I would be online then. What they meant, in fact, was that they would send the modem and other stuff for getting connected yesterday. I am still going to leave it until I am connected before I pass judgement on TalkTalk, but the thought of how little it is costing me keeps me going for the moment.</p>

<h3>Posting Whilst At Work?</h3>

<p>So you probably think I am skimping on my job and tending to Unintentionally Blank at the moment, but you would be wrong. You see, not only am I not online at home yet, I also fell ill yesterday. Leaving work early and catching the tube home whilst holding back my stomach back was not a pleasant end to the day and added to my misfortune, confining my premature excitement to the bin.</p>

<p>Today was spent sitting at home, drinking tea, eating soup and watching <a href="http://www.familyguy.com">Family Guy</a>. Not a great day. I think I'll go and put the kettle on, sit back in front of the television and wait for the modem to drop through my door. And just in case my overly excitable post caused yesterday to be terrible, <em> I'm definitely not looking forward to playing a <a href="http://ww.hammervsthesnake.co.uk">gig this Saturday</a></em>!</p>

<p>Anyway, it wasn't all bad.</p>

<p>I <em>did</em> get paid!</p>
