<p>Congratulations to Tony Blair, the owner of one of the 3 websites to reach the minimum accessibility standards of the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WACG</abbr> in the recent <a href="http://www.nomensa.com/nomensa/live/news/at-nomensa/2006/12/nomensa-publishes-global-audit-with-united-nations.html">accessibility review by Nomensa</a> commissioned by the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> as part of its <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/disiddp.htm">International Day of Disabled Persons</a>.</p>
<h3>Disappointing</h3>
<p>97% of websites tested failed to reach any level of accessibility. 93% of sites did not provide alt attributes for graphics. 98% did not follow industry standards for coding. (<a href="http://www.nomensa.com/nomensa/live/news/at-nomensa/2006/12/nomensa-publishes-global-audit-with-united-nations.html">more disappointing stats</a>)</p>
<h3>Promising</h3>
<p>However bad the results are, at least they have been exposed, it has hit the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6210068.stm">news</a> and was the subject of one of the accessibility presentations at the UN. This sort of global publicity for the inaccessibility of most major websites should hopefully encourage more and more companies to take action. There is no quick solution, but the more pressure to provide one there is, the closer we move towards an internet in which everyone is equally important and therefore equally able to use every site.</p>
