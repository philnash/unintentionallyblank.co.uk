<p>There is a lot of serious discussion going on regarding yesterday's announcement about <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2008/01/23/version-targeting-for-ie8-developer-wars-my-thoughts/">version targeting in IE8</a>, so I thought we could take a time out, an short break in the heavy thinking with this brief interlude.</p>

<p>The UK has been slipping behind in broadband speeds recently and it looks like it will cost a lot to catch up and install the upgraded fibre that we need. That is, until the BBC reported today that it is possible to lay these <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7202396.stm">super-fast broadband cables in the sewers</a> to save money.</p>

<p>Is it just me or does this sound a lot like <a href="http://www.google.com/tisp/install.html">a scheme Google announced in <em>April</em> last year</a>? If my toilet can give me a 100<abbr title="Mega Bits Per Second">mbps</abbr> connection, I'll be happy. I'm just glad I won't be the one laying the fibre!</p>

<p>Now, back to the debate!</p>
