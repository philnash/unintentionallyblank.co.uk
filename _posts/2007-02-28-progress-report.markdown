<p>Yesterday I posted my <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/02/26/procrastinationmotivation">list of things to do this week</a> and I wanted to report on how it was going. Top of my list of tasks was to have a go at Aaron Brazell's custom fields competition. Just now I finished my quick effort and was quite pleased for the time it had taken. Then I found out <a href="http://technosailor.com/wordpress-custom-fields-contest-extended/">the competition deadline had been extended</a>. I didn't know whether to be annoyed that I put so much effort in tonight or pleased that I have extra time to complete bits that had fallen by the wayside in the rush!</p>

<p>I think I'm happy about it really. I learnt about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Custom_Fields">custom fields</a>, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin">writing plugins</a> and <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page">microformats</a> and got a positive result with my first bit of plugin wrangling. I can't tell you what I have been doing as it's for a competition and I don't want to give all my ideas away! I will be posting on all the topics above once I have finished though. In the meantime I get to have another, more in depth go at my entry and really impress in the competition, as well as creating a useful plugin that anyone can use <em>and</em> learning all the time.</p>

<p>No time for this tomorrow though (I'll have to schedule some more time for it next week), I've got to sort myself some job applications instead. Isn't everything exciting at the moment?</p>
