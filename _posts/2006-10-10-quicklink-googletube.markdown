<p>Master of search and advertising, Google certainly doesn't waste time in it's business ventures! On Friday, I was surprised to read the unsubstantiated, and self proclaimed 40% likely, rumour that<a href="http://www.webpronews.com/insiderreports/searchinsider/wpn-49-20061006RumorofTheWeekGoogleToBuyYouTube.html"> Google was to buy YouTube</a>. Now I see that they have <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/google_youtube.html">paid $1.65 billion for the social video site</a>.</p>
<p>So what of <a href="http://video.google.com">Google Video</a>? What does this tell us about Google's current strategies? First <a href="http://news.com.com/Google+pledges+900+million+for+MySpace+honors/2100-1032_3-6102952.html">search and advertising on Myspace</a> now they buy up another popular social site, have they run out of ideas or did they miss the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2">web 2.0</a> boat and decided to throw their money into catching up? What do you think?</p>
<p>Then again, $1.65 billion... if only I had that much to spend.</p>
