<p>A bit of fun for a Saturday, <a href="http://www.justsayhi.com/bb/html_quiz">how many HTML 4 elements can you name in 5 minutes</a>?</p>

<p>I made some silly mistakes, forgot some essential elements and only guessed a couple out of sheer luck, when the pressure is on everything flies out of your head!</p>

<p>I got 56 out of 91, let me know how you do.</p>
