<p>Spam is top of a lot of people's agenda at the moment. What with the new <a href="http://www.buyblogcomments.com" rel="nofollow">spam comments service</a> that <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/07/09/buy-blog-comments-a-sick-new-comment-spam-service-launches/">Darren Rowse has voiced complaint about</a> (for the record, I don't agree with it either) and seemingly a <a href="http://www.emomsathome.com/blog/2007/07/10/is-akismet-sick-or-did-i-piss-off-the-spammers-too-much/">lot of spam getting through Akismet at the moment</a>. I myself am finding a lot of spam getting into my email inbox at the moment, even though <a href="http://www.gmail.com">GMail</a> is normally quite good at filtering it all out.</p>

<p>I don't want to complain about spam right now though, as I received one of the less well thought out messages recently that gave me a good giggle. Very early this morning I received the following email:</p>

<blockquote><p>MICROSOFT AWARD PROMOTION DEPARTMENT<br />

Batch: 742701AE</p>

<p>Lucky Winner<br />

<p>Great Britain Pounds)<br />
Contact our Fiduciary agent<br />
Mr.James Bennett  Claims Agent)<br />
E-mail:claimsagentuk9@yahoo.co.uk</p></blockquote>

<p>My claims agent from the <strong>Microsoft</strong> Award Promotion Department has a <strong>Yahoo email address</strong>? I can't wait for the day I receive a well thought out spam email, until then I will continue to laugh whilst I dump these in the spam folder.</p>

<p>Had any ridiculous spam recently? I'd love to see what you get too.</p>

<p><ins>Edit: More spam! I have just seen that <a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2007/07/11/two-billion/">Akismet has just passed the 2 billion mark</a>, will nothing stop these crazy spammers?</ins></p>
