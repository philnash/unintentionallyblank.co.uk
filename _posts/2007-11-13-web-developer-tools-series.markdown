<p>Since starting <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/07/03/the-end-of-one-good-thing-and-the-start-of-something-really-special/">full time in the web development industry</a> 4 months ago I have picked up a number of different tools I use every day to make my life easier and my coding quicker. A lot are based on my favourite browser, <a href="http:///www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>, some can be used with any browser and others are the simplest of text editors.</p>

<p>Over the coming weeks I am going to share with you my experiences of each tool I use daily for development. With any luck I will introduce you to a few new tools that you may not have heard of and will help you out. I would also like to hear what your favourite development tools are too and if there are any I am missing out on.</p>

<p>So, keep an eye out for my web developer tools series, first part coming out later this week.</p>
