<p>It seems to me that web <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200505/accessibility_myths_and_misconceptions/">accessibility can often be mistaken as being only for blind users</a>. This couldn't be further from the truth, it affects a lot of people from the severely disabled to people who can't see their screen properly because the sun is shining on it.</p>

<h3>How Do We Help These Other Cases Then?</h3>

<p>First you need to know what you are dealing with. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>1.0</a> gives a good idea of the different challenges users may face when using your site:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"><ul><li>They may not be able to see, hear, move, or may not be able to process some types of information easily or at all.</li>
<li>They may have difficulty reading or comprehending text.
   </li><li>They may not have or be able to use a keyboard or mouse.
   </li><li>They may have a text-only screen, a small screen, or
       a slow Internet connection.
   </li><li>They may not speak or understand fluently
       the language in which the document is written.
   </li><li>They may be in a situation where their eyes, ears, or
       hands are busy or interfered with (e.g., driving to work, 
       working in a loud environment, etc.).
   </li><li>They may have an early version of a browser, a different
       browser entirely, a voice browser, or a 
       different operating system.
  </li></ul></blockquote>

<p>So accessibility on the web needs to consider those who are fully able, but may just be in a different situation to how you expect people to use the web, like not using a keyboard or mouse or being interfered with whilst surfing.</p>
