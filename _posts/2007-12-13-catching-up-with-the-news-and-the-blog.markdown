<p>It has been a busy couple of weeks! I have been finishing my first full project at work, finishing a side project for work in my spare time, polishing off a couple of sites that I had ideas about a while ago and generally ignoring this blog! The web development world keeps spinning though so I have thrown together a few important stories that have happened since my last post, just in case you missed them.</p>

<h3>WCAG 2.0 Last Working Draft In Call For Review</h3>

<p>The once slated <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guideline">WCAG</abbr> 2.0 working draft came up for public review again yesterday. It has been through review once and is ready for more scrutinizing from the public. See the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2007OctDec/0060.html">call for review</a> for all the details.</p>

<h3>The Next Version Of IE Gets A Name</h3>

<p>It might have seemed obvious to most, but the next version of everybody's favourite browser, Internet Explorer, will be called IE8. It took Bill Gates to break it, but it is official now, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/12/05/internet-explorer-8.aspx">IE.Next is IE8</a>.</p>

<h3>The Bizarre And Oh So Far Away HTML 5</h3>

<p>Lachlan Hunt <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/previewofhtml5">previewed <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5 over at A List Apart</a>. There is a lot to HTML5, new elements, new ways of thinking, semantics, structure and I admit that, even after reading the article there is still a lot to think about. Is this the right path to take? What about <abbr title="eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>? Will the expected 10 - 15 years it is likely to take to come into play going to kill it before it even makes it to a recommendation? At the moment, I don't know what to think.</p>

<h3>A Race?</h3>

<p>So, December has seen steps taken for HTML5, WCAG2.0 and IE8, but which will we see in use first? HTML5 looks out of the running, IE6 is still the world's most used browser over IE7 and WCAG 2.0 took a beating last year, has it improved enough to get a more pleasant reception now? 2008 should be an interesting year for web development.</p>
