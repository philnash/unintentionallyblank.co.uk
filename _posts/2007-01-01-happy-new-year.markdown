<p>Welcome to 2007! A night out last night left me pretty quiet today, but I couldn't wait until tomorrow and decided to head to the keyboard to get out my first post of the new year! </p>
<p>And what an exciting new year it will be. You can see <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/12/22/unintentionally-blank-predictions-07/">my predictions</a> for the upcoming months, but what about my aims? There are a number of things I hope to achieve this year and the best way of ensuring that I complete my targets is writing them down and showing the world, at least, in theory it is. This is the first year I have ever thought I needed to do this, so here goes:</p>

<h3>My New Year's Resolutions</h3>

<h4>Blogging Goals</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Post more!</dt>
<dd>I have neglected this blog, but when I get my own internet connection back, there will be no stopping me! Plus, as Liz Strauss points out, there are many reasons to <a href="http://www.successful-blog.com/1/10-reasons-to-write-and-publish-every-day/">write every day</a>.</dd>
<dt>Read more blogs.</dt>
<dd>There is wealth of information and life out in the blogosphere that I am yet to discover and I mean to find more of it. There is no better way to get me to read your blog than leave me a comment, by the way, so drop by and say hello!</dd>
<dt>Release a <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> theme.</dt>
<dd>There's a designer in me just waiting to break out!</dd>
<dt>Release a plug-in.</dt>
<dd>Both of these are part of me wanting to give something back to the blogging community as a whole, let's hope I come up with something useful!</dd>
<dt>Make a bit of money!</dt>
<dd>Hey, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?193476">hosting</a> doesn't pay for itself! I'll keep looking to the advice of <a href="http://www.problogger.net/">Darren Rowse</a> for this, if anyone can help, he can.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Real Life Goals</h4>

<dl>
<dt>Get fit.</dt>
<dd>Too much sitting in an office all day is going to waste me, so I will be putting efforts into making myself exercise this year. First things first, start running a couple of times a week. Then find a rugby club and get back into a real sport!</dd>
<dt>Get a new job.</dt>
<dd>The one I've got is fine, but my casual contract runs out in September and I'd quite like to jump ship before then and find something which interests me more. I'd love to work with the internet in some way, but I don't know how yet.</dd>
</dl>

<p>That's it, less real life goals than blogging ones, but they are big ones so I don't want to make it impossible for myself. I really look forward to achieving all of the above, so don't let me give up on any of these aims.</p>
<p>What are your aims for the new year? Share them here, or on your own blog, and let's achieve our plans together.</p>
<p>Oh, and I hope you had a great celebration yesterday! Here's to 2007 being a great year!</p>
