<p>Today I spent a little time improving my comment area just for you. At least I tried, here's what I did:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Gravatars</dt>
<dd>Pictures are wonderful, so if you have a <a href="http://www.gravatar.com">gravatar</a> and make a comment, your gravatar will now appear thanks to <a href="http://www.skippy.net/blog/2005/03/24/gravatars/">Skippy's Gravatar Plugun</a>. This had to be the easiest addition to the site today, just a few touches added to the style sheet and voila!</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Comment Subscriptions</dt>
<dd><a href="http://nektros.com/2006/08/17/how-to-spice-up-your-comments-area-part-1/5/">Yvonne</a> <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/09/08/stuff-i-couldnt-use-firefox-without/#comment-736">keeps telling me</a> to implement comment subscriptions. So I did. If you want to keep up with the comments on any post after you comment, just make sure you have the subscribe box ticked. I even styled the subscription manager to look like the rest of the site (a must in my opinion). Thanks to Mark Jaquith for the <a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/">comment subscription plugin</a>.</dd>
<dt>Related Posts</dt>
<dd>I have wanted to display a list of related posts for each post for ages. It seems like such a good idea. I am getting most of my traffic from search engines at the moment and the ability to show people, who just come across the site from a specific search, what else they can find here is brilliant. Thanks to Alex for the <a href="http://www.w-a-s-a-b-i.com/archives/2006/02/02/wordpress-related-entries-20/">related posts plugin</a>, another easy one to implement.</dd>
<dt>Live Preview</dt>
<dd>I think I have implemented the <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/LiveCommentPreview">live preview plugin</a> but I can't see it working. If it works for anyone else please let me know!</dd>
<dt>Chunk <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>s</dt>
<dd>Finally, just in case any of you thought you'd post a really long link and break my template, you can't anymore, not with <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/LiveCommentPreview">wp-chunk</a>. Why would you do this anyway, since I have the nice and easy <a href="http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/">Markdown</a> plugin too?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Are these plugins working for everyone else (especially the live comments)? What else am I missing that would make life easier around here? Do you have a favourite plugin that every Wordpress blog should have? Let me know!</p>
