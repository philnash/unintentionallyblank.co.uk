<p>Yahoo! announced today that <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000527.html">Yahoo! Search is to support semantic web standards</a> to enhance their search. This is fantastic news for anyone interested in semantic technologies as well as the general public. Why? Because Yahoo! Search is big enough to be the tipping point, the breakthrough point for semantics on the web.</p>

<h3>The Problems That Previously Faced Semantic Technology</h3>

<p>There are a number of ways of implementing semantics on a web site, from the original methods defined by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web#Descriptive_and_extensible">RDF and OWL</a> to <a href="http://microformats.org/about/">microformats</a>, built on <abbr title="(eXtensible) Hyper Text Markup Language">(X)HTML</abbr>, technology we already have and use. The issue is that there seems no real reason for anyone to use these standards; sure, marking up content so that machines can understand it is all very well, but what's the use if there are no machines reading it?</p>

<p>Up until today only a few technologies supported certain standards, the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4106">Operator extension</a> for Firefox supports microformats, as will Firefox 3 when it is released, but none of these are big enough or important enough for the mainstream. Adding semantics to a website is a lot of hard work if no-one is around to use it.</p>

<h3>Time For The Big Guns</h3>

<p>This is why Yahoo!'s announcement is so big. Now there <em>are</em> machines reading that data <em>and</em> using it <em>and</em> enriching the web with it, do you, as a developer or site owner, want to miss out on that? Yahoo!'s search is to use microformats initially, to improve their understanding of the data to return more relevant results (and, from the looks of their example with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> add more detail to their search results). So, will other search engines, I'm looking at Google and Microsoft here, want to miss out on the wealth of data that they aren't collecting and Yahoo! is?</p>

<p>Now it will be beneficial for developers to include microformats and other semantic data as Yahoo! is reading and using it. It will be <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yahoo_supports_semantic_web.php">beneficial for other search engines</a> to get in on the act, as they don't want to lose market share to a more relevant Yahoo!. Furthermore, it will then be even more beneficial for developers to include the information as everyone watches what Google is doing! Then, with the wealth of semantic data going around, startups and other small web companies will be able to leverage the data for their own uses producing a whole new wave of technologies: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/on_web_30.php">web 3.0</a> anybody?</p>

<h3>The Semantic Web Is Coming And Everyone Wins</h3>

<p>What could be better, a reason to include semantic technologies in your site, better search results, new, intelligent services? I can only say thank you to Yahoo! for supporting this and giving it the much needed boost.</p>
