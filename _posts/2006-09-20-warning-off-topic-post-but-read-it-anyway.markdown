<p>Yeah, this is off topic, but I have to tell everyone I can about the amazing news I received yesterday. It won't take me long, but I have to get it off my chest. Here goes...</p>
<p><strong>My band, <a href="http://www.hammervsthesnake.co.uk">Hammer VS The Snake</a> were played on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/stevelamacq/index.shtml">Steve Lamacq's</a> show on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/">Radio 1</a> on Monday night!</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge thing for us because we are relatively unknown! We are a student band from Oxford who play local gigs and won the Oxford Student Union battle of the bands in 2005. Since then we recorded two EPs and have received some good reviews from local magazines, also getting one of our songs played on BBC Oxford's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/content/articles/2005/10/14/download_team.shtml">The Download</a>.</p>
<p>But now this, national radio play, completely out of the blue! Thanks so much to Steve Lamacq for playing new, unknown bands and for liking our stuff! If you want to hear us, check out our <a href="http://www.hammervsthesnake.co.uk/downloads.php">downloads page</a> or listen to the newest EP, Goods, at our <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hammervsthesnake">myspace page</a>. And if you do, please let me know what you think!</p>
