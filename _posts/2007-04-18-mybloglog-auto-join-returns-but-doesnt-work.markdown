<p>The <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com">MyBlogLog</a> feature of <a href="http://mybloglogb.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/04/the_return_of_t.html">auto joining a community once you had visited it enough times is back</a>. This is a great feature as it gives an organic growth to communities, joining people up to yours if they happen to visit it a number of times but never remember to click to the <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/unintentionallyblank/">join the community</a>.</p>

<h3>It Half Works</h3>

<p>I received an email notification this morning that I had auto joined two communities, <a href="http://momgadget.com">Momgadget</a> and <a href="http://thewrongadvices.com/">The Wrong Advices</a>. Sure enough, they both show up in <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/philnash/communities/">my communities</a>, but  there is no sign of me in <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/momgadget/">their</a> <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/TheWrongAdvices/">communities</a>.</p>

<p>I appreciate that there is a lot to be done, sorting spam, moving to Yahoo, etc. and I am glad that things are moving forward. I was particularly happy when they put a few more measures in to <a href="http://mybloglogb.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/04/mybloglog_is_re.html">stop gaming MyBlogLog</a>. I was just sad to see that a previously active feature has been announced again and doesn't work.</p>

<p><strong>Come on MyBlogLog, I like the service, keep up the good work and sort this out!</strong></p>

<p>In other news, I will be finishing the second part of <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/03/06/making-mybloglog-pretty-how-to-style-the-recent-readers-widget/">how to style the MyBlogLog readers list</a> soon, but everything is busy, busy, busy at the minute!</p>

<ins style="text-decoration:none; font-style:italic;">Edit: It seems to have worked now, I am now a member of both the communities I mention. I wonder if there is a time delay on appearing in your communities that you auto joined or if it was a bug that the team have quickly ironed out. Either way, I'm glad to see it's working now!</ins>
