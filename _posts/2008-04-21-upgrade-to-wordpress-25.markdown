<p>Apologies for the lack of updates recently, all this <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2008/04/14/plastered-weekend/">sitting about with my feet up</a> has sort of put me off the computer for a while. I did upgrade my version of WordPress this evening to 2.5 (that's right, check the number at the bottom of the page!), just so I could use the new light and airy admin interface designed by certain people I highly respect at <a href="http://www.happycog.com/">Happy Cog Studios</a>. Thankfully nothing went wrong, that I can see, but if you do happen to spot anything, do let me know.</p>

<p>Have you upgraded yet? If so, do you like the new interior? My favourite part is automatically upgrading plugins, but the design and usability is beautiful too.</p>
