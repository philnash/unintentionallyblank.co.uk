<p>First <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000425.html">Yahoo released their oneSearch</a>, now <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/03/walking-talking-searching-finding.html">Google have improved their mobile search</a>. The mobile web is growing and the big search engines are pinpointing how we like to search and use our mobile devices. Now they will look to localise results and return information within the search page rather than make us click through. Yahoo will return results in your area for searches for things like movies and food and will return local news, weather and traffic reports if you type in a city. Google too promises to make an informed decision over whether you want web, local or image searches based on what you input.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yahoo_onesearch_mobile_web.php">Read/Write Web broke the story on oneSearch</a>, they had me sold. The next time I was going to use my mobile to look something up, I was going to go straight for Yahoo as opposed to my standard use of Google. Now it has all changed and I have a decision to make again. I will be trying out both Google's new mobile search and Yahoo's oneSearch to find out which suits me best. I need to know who provides the best data, which search is quicker, who's search is the most accurate in my area and ultimately which search answers my questions the best. I'll post my results when I've decided.</p>

<p>In the meantime, what mobile search engine do you prefer? Do you tend to stick to your favourite desk top search or do you shop around? Do you even use the mobile web? Let me know your thoughts on the potential competition here.</p>
