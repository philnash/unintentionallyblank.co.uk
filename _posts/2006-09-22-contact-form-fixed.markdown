<p>Good news, my <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/contact/">contact page</a> is now fixed. I tried to write my own contact form but had trouble with the theme based construction of wordpress, so I went looking for another plugin. I have settled with Dagon Design's <a href="http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/secure-form-mailer-plugin-for-wordpress/">Secure Form Mailer Plugin</a>, but without using it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha"><acronym title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</acronym></a> function. It was easy to install and set working, it is highly customisable and available in a non-plugin form too. If you are looking for a contact form for your blog, I recommend it.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Go send me an email!</p>
