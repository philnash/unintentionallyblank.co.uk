<p>Unintentionally this blog has become a chronicle of not only my thoughts and feelings on web standards but also of my journey through my career in the same field. <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/09/30/out-of-the-blue-a-job/">In September 2006 I got my first job</a>, a temporary role in the civil service that got me out of the house, but onto a <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/10/15/commuting-not-a-way-of-life/">hellish commute</a>. I moved to London shortly after and then in July last year I moved into web development, <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/07/03/the-end-of-one-good-thing-and-the-start-of-something-really-special/">starting work with VYRE</a>.</p>

<p>Once again things have changed. A couple of months ago I spotted an exciting job opportunity in an advert in the sidebar of a blog. Had I not seen it, not read it, I would still be working with VYRE. However, fate had some hand in things and after reading more deeply into the offering I decided this was to be my next step. I applied and, after the interview process and my notice period, I started on Monday.</p>

<h3>What Now?</h3>

<p>I continue as a front end developer, but now, instead of working with <a href="http://www.vyre.com/products/vyre-unify/">VYRE's Unify <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> framework</a>, I will be developing with the open source <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>. I will be working for <a href="http://www.mintdigital.com">Mint Digital</a> who do all sorts of interesting stuff trying to bridge the gap between new media and old.</p>

<p>So over the last three days I've been learning a whole lot of stuff really quickly, installing Ruby and Rails, getting to grips with Subversion for the first time as well as familiarising myself with the OS X terminal. All along while trying to pick up as much Ruby knowledge as possible, mainly from <a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/">Why's bizarre, sorry, poignant guide to Ruby</a>.</p>

<p>It's an exciting time as I embark on this new venture. Things may slow down here for a while as I am reading a lot and taking a lot in at the moment, but they will pick up again (you may even see a couple of extra categories pop up, Ruby and Rails perhaps, we'll see). I was also redesigning, but that might have to wait too (only because an even better design just popped into my head this evening).</p>

<p>It's been an interesting journey on this blog so far and I still think things are just beginning. Let's see what happens next.</p>
