<p>I just signed up to <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a>, I have been using <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> more and more recently, I occasionally <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> worthy sites and I have a small <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com">MyBlogLog</a> community. Sites and services like this are great fun, useful and part of the whole web 2.0 experience. Having been pretty quiet online, save for this blog and a few comments I make on others' blogs, I am not really a member of any community. This means that I have been missing out on one of the main ingredients in this social Internet: friends.</p>

<p>I'm not complaining about being lonely, I just want someone to share <a href="http://del.icio.us/philnash">my bookmarks</a> with, someone who might enjoy <a href="http://www.digg.com/users/philnash/news/dugg">articles that I digg</a>, someone to guide <a href="http://philnash.stumbleupon.com/about/">my stumbling</a>, even a few more members in <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/unintentionallyblank/">my MyBlogLog community</a>. So go on, add me, make me your friend on any of the above and let me share more of my experiences with you.</p>

<p>It's not all selfish though, I want to see what <em>you</em> have bookmarked, what <em>you</em> digg, what <em>you</em> like to stumble. I'd like to join <em>your</em> community, read <em>your</em> blog and be <em>your</em> friend too. Web 2.0 is the social web and I want to play a bigger part in it.</p>

<p>While we are on this topic, if you have any tips for how to use these services not to increase traffic, but to get a better experience of the web, please leave me a comment. I'd be very interested to hear how you use any of the sites I mention above, or whatever your favourite web 2.0 site is.</p>
