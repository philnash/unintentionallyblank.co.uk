<p>Just a quick question, to anyone who has subscribed to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ub">my feed</a>. Can you see the full article, or is it a dreaded partial feed?</p>
<p>I certainly mean for it to be a full feed, those are the selected options in the dashboard, but I just tried to view the feed within <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> (which is growing on me, albeit slowly) and only got the partial feed. If anyone has come across this sort of problem before, please let me know why it's happening and if there is anything I can do.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
