<p>I am going to upgrade my computer. My current PC isn't the flashiest box out there at the moment, in fact, with a Celeron processor and 256<abbr title="Mega Bytes">MB</abbr> of <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> it's pretty sluggish. I am due an upgrade.</p>

<p>What's with the title then? Well I have been considering my options for this upgrade and I am leaning towards the idea of getting a Mac. I was hoping you could help though. I've never had a Mac and I have never seriously used one (wandering into the Apple Store and playing about on one doesn't count). I have always used PCs (except for my <em>old</em> Amiga 500, those were the days) and need some help deciding what is right for me.</p>

<h3>Can You Help?</h3>

<p>Do you have experience, good or bad, with Macs? Can you tell me why I should be getting one? Can you tell me why I shouldn't, why I should stick with a trusty PC?</p>

<p>I like coding and making websites, listening to music and surfing the web. My girlfriend loves uploading digital photos. Should we stick with what we know or change things up a bit?</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them. I'm a little confused right now as I try to justify spending almost double on an Apple over a PC. I hope you can help me out, or at least point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
