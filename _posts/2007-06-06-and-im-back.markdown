<p>Did you miss me?</p>

<p>Where have I been, I hear you ask? I have, in fact, spent the last week in Norway in and around Oslo. Why? Well, you know when a friend calls up and asks if you want to go to Norway in a couple of weeks time, you can't say no! The rush of preparing and tying up other loose ends at home left me no time to write anything to be published whilst I was away, so this place has been a bit silent. I have, however, enjoyed a week of camping, beautiful sights, fantastic art and a theme park, so I can't really complain!</p>

<p>Still, I'm back now, refreshed and reinvigorated, with new ideas and some new projects too (very exciting stuff in terms of personal and professional development). You should expect to hear from me again soon. In the meantime, I've got about 1000 new posts in my feed reader to get through and find out what I've missed in the last week.</p>

<p>Bye for now!</p>
