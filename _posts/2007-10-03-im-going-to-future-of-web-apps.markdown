<p>The <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps</a> conference is in London and I am lucky enough to be going along for the whole day tomorrow.</p>

<p>There are some incredibly interesting presentations, and I'm particularly looking forward to <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/speakers.html#DaveMorin">Dave Morin</a> talking about the <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> platform, John Aizen &amp; <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/speakers.html#EranShir">Eran Shir</a> from <a href="http://www.dapper.com">Dapper</a> talk about the semantic web, assumedly along the lines of the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_top-down_semantic_web.php">top down approach recently analysed over at Read/Write Web</a>.</p>

<p>Also, after spending a good deal of time looking at various <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">AIR</a> (Adobe Integrated Runtime) applications today and being very impressed by the potential, I will be visiting as many Adobe presentations as possible.</p>

<p>If you happen to be reading this blog <em>and</em> are attending tomorrow too, look out for me and say hi. I'll be easy to spot, I'll be the one lugging the massive and old looking Dell laptop around looking for power slots as the battery lasts no longer than 20 minutes at a time. If you're not going, look out for the podcasts and videos after the event as well as my reactions, which I will post later this week.</p>
