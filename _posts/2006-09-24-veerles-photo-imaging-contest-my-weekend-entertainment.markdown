<p>The irresistable urge to take part in competitions run by other bloggers has overcome me twice this week. Firstly, I submitted my <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2006/09/19/if-internet-explorer-then-do-something-else-a-how-to/">how to</a>, for the <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/09/18/problogger-group-writing-project-how-to/">ProBlogger group writing project</a> (look out for another one soon), now I've had a go at <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/blog/comments/veerles_photo_imaging_contest/">Veerle's Photo Imaging Contest</a>. The idea was simple, Veerle supplied four different pictures of herself and all you had to do was manipulate (at least) one of them in a creative or witty way. There are prizes on offer, but it is a bit of fun too.</p>
<h3>Photo Imaging, Manipulation?</h3>
<p>Yeah, alright, I mainly deal with lines and lines of boring looking code, but I have been known to crack out Fireworks and have a go with graphics. Anyway, what is better than having some fun with a picture of someone else, eh? If you're interested, you can see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81466434@N00/251588062/in/pool-veerlesphotoimagingcontest/">my attempt on flickr</a> and if you're really interested, you have until Wednesday to submit a picture yourself.</p>
<p>I would like to wish everyone who has taken part so far good luck. I have seen some amazing entries and obviously a lot of work in some places, as well as some hilarious ideas. Most of the entries are also available at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/veerlesphotoimagingcontest/pool/">flickr group</a>.</p>
<p>I'd also like to say thanks to Veerle for running a great competition!</p>
