<p><a href="http://www.hammervsthesnake.co.uk">Hammer VS The Snake</a>, the band I am very proud to be a part of, are back on the radio again tonight! As if featuring on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/stevelamacq/index.shtml">Steve Lamacq</a> wasn't enough, HVTS will be on <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk">Xfm</a> tonight, as part of the <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk/article.asp?id=5262">Music:Response</a> show.</p>
<p>DJ Sarah Darling will be playing our track Blame in the Xfm Unsigned section of the show. You can listen to Blame on the <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk/article.asp?id=94145">Xfm Unsigned site</a>, as well as this week's other unsigned acts, or listen all week at 9:45pm. If you like any of them, you can <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk/article.asp?id=105880">vote for your favourite</a> which will get played on Friday too.</p>
<p>However impartial I would love to be, this is my begging section. I hope that you like my band's music, but please vote for them to be played again! It will help us no end to reach more music lovers and get our music out there. You can listen to more of our music at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hammervsthesnake" title="Hammer VS The Snake at myspace">myspace</a> too. I hope you like it.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you vote for us, I will also love you forever. Thanks</p>

<p><ins>Update: Hammer VS The Snake were <em>meant</em> to be played last night on Xfm, however it seemed the DJ changed her mind and played the unsigned band that were scheduled for Wednesday. Keep listening to Xfm all this week to hear HVTS come up and in the meantime, you can still <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk/article.asp?id=105880">vote for us</a> to be played on Friday too.</ins></p>
