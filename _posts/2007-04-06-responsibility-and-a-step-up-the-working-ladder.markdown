<p>I don't have the best job in the world, I'm not currently employed in something I wish to do for very much longer, but every day I spend there gives me more experience, makes me understand business a little better and makes me worth just that little bit more to my next employer. The other day I took a big step up.</p>

<p>Most of my day is spent solving problems. We have a new human resources system with a load of problems (mostly user error, but I'm not going into that right now) and my job, along with the rest of the team is to fix these problems, improve the system and eventually realise a project that has been ongoing for a number of years now. Basically, I am part of a help desk, so I now know about things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Level_Agreement">Service Level Agreements</a> and occasionally hear about change management. Most of it goes over my head and I continue to work away at the problems suffered by individuals or groups using the system. Until this week that is.</p>

<h3>Responsibility, But I'm A Casual!</h3>

<p>I have been in the job for 6 months now and last month I received a promotion of sorts. No further responsibility but some extra money for doing well at my job. Both a bonus and an endorsement of the work I have put into the project so far. I was still on a casual contract and I'm still at the bottom of the ladder.</p>

<p>This week was different though. I got my own little project fixing and using one part of the system! A bit of pressure, due to it being finance related and the end of the financial year, and a bit of responsibility as this project was previously being managed by my manager's manager's manager (not a typo, three levels of management up)!</p>

<p>Why am I impressed by this? Firstly, a lot of what I do is hands on, fixing the system, telling users what they have done wrong, correcting data. For this project I was told explicitly that I was managing, <em>not doing</em>, the process. My job now is to know what is going on and instruct others on how to do it. Also, this is recognition in not only the hard work I have been putting in so far, but that I can achieve more. Having graduated only last summer I am new to business and have no management experience at all, being given an opportunity to grow like this is both exciting and adds to my <abbr title="Curriculum Vitae">CV</abbr>, do well and my reference from my current place of work increases in value too.</p>

<h3>Where Now?</h3>

<p>First, I have to hope that everything goes smoothly. I have now put everything in place for stage one of the project and I am relying on people with more experience than me to take my instruction and go with it. Once this mini project is finished I hope to go on to bigger things, I want to increase my experience, my worth to my current employer and my worth in the future.</p>

<p>Hard work does pay off, I've taken one small step up the ladder and soon enough it will be time to take the next one. Whether by moving job or taking on more important and interesting roles in my current one, I feel as though I have a lot more to offer. Let's see what the future has to offer me.</p>
