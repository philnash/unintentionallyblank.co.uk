<p><em>I nearly did!</em></p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/">24 Ways 2007</a> for this year's advent calendar of web development tips. This year already includes <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/css-for-accessibility">simple accessibility with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></a>, an explanation of the <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/my-other-christmas-present-is-a-definition-list" rel="nofollow">proper use of definition lists</a> (which I don't agree with), a <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/increase-your-font-stacks-with-font-matrix">font matrix</a> to help with finding out how popular certain fonts are and a method for <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/keeping-javascript-dependencies-at-bay">smart loading of JavaScript components</a>.</p>

<p>Go have a look now, just like Christmas, there's something for everyone.</p>
