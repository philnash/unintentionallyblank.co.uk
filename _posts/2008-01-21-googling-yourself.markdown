<p>Come on, everyone has done it, putting your own name into Google to see what appears in the results or whether your blog is first. OK, so maybe I have had a slow Sunday as I come to write this, but I am pleased with my current results in the world's biggest search engine. For a start I have had the top results for searches for Phil Nash for quite a while now, however there is a greater prize at stake. Taking the top spot for just a first name is quite a challenge and something I (quite excitingly!) find myself moving closer to every time I check.</p>

<p>So, I am even more pleased to say that I am one of the top 100 Phils in the world according to Google, appearing at 69 on Google.com, 32 on Google.co.uk and number 8 on Google.co.uk when searching for "pages from the UK". To make it to the top will be tough, I will have to beat Phil Collins, the UK number 1, and Dr Phil for the coveted spot on Google.com, but I reckon I have time on my side and the patience!</p>

<p>Of course, the real aim is to to achieve something that amounts to high levels of geek cool like <a href="http://photomatt.net">Matt Mullenweg</a>'s <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/04/07/im-2-on-google/">business card</a> (which reads "1. Go to google.com 2. Type in "Matt" 3. Press "I'm feeling lucky").</p>

<p>One day I will have that! One day!</p>

<p>Have you googled yourself lately?</p>
