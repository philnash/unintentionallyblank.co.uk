<p>Last week, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/03/personality-goes-long-way.html">Google announced themes for their personalised homepage</a>. I love using the personal homepage and thought this was an innovative and endearing idea, even though it is quite a move from Google's standard stark white background. My one problem was that I couldn't use it to start with.</p>

<h3>What Themes?</h3>

<p>A lot of <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-03-20-n28.html">places</a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/google-homepage/customize-your-google-homepage-with-themes-245471.php">mentioned</a> the <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/03/themes-for-google-personalized-homepage.html">new themes</a>, with special mention to Tony Ruscoe for <a href="http://ruscoe.net/blog/2007/03/google-personalized-homepage-easter.asp">finding some of the Easter Eggs already</a>, but, as the image below shows, there was no indication how to add a theme to the page.</p>

<img src='http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/personalised.gif' alt='Google Personalised Homepage' class="alignleft" />

<p>I returned to <a href="http://tech-buzz.net/2007/03/21/google-personalized-homepage-gets-themes/">Tech Buzz</a>, where I originally read the story, read it all again, clicked on the link to Google and found the select theme link instantly.</p>
<img src='http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/select-theme.gif' alt='The select theme link appeared.' class="alignright" />

<h3>The Difference?</h3>

<p>My bookmarks were previously set to <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/ig">http://www.google.co.uk/ig</a>, but clicking on the link from the Tech Buzz article took me to <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">http://www.google.<strong>com</strong>/ig</a>. It seems that google.co.uk doesn't allow themes yet, but google.com does. It doesn't make much difference, all I have to do is change my bookmarks, but it does mean that I lose the ability to search sites from just the UK from my homepage. Still, if you use google.co.uk, but want to see their new themes you will have to do this for now.</p>

<h3>The Only Difference?</h3>

<p>Apart from themes, I have also found that the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/render">Google Calendar</a> widget works much better on google.com, highlighting days with events on and displaying your agenda as well as allowing you to add events, seemingly the only feature on the google.co.uk incarnation. If you use google.co.uk have you noticed these or any other differences? Is the better functionality of google.com enough to get you to change your bookmark/homepage?</p>
