<p>Considering? The vulnerability only means that a malicious website can hijack a Windows PC and install anything they want. Anti-Spyware firm Sunbelt-Software have discovered sites using this vunerability to download spyware, including keyloggers, and adware onto unsuspecting users computers. Aren't <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users lucky that Microsoft are <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/09/22/458266.aspx"><em>thinking about</em> releasing a patch</a> before their monthly update, next due on the 10th of October?</p>
<p>If you have IE and are worried, <a href="http://isotf.org/zert/"><acronym title="Zeroday Emergency Response Team">ZERT</acronym></a> have released an unofficial patch for the time being. The other, better option, of course, being to get <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> instead.</p>
<p><ins>Update (27/09/06): Microsoft <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/09/26/459237.aspx">have released</a> the patch now, though they still claim that the attacks they had seen exploiting the bug were <q>very limited</q>.</ins></p>
