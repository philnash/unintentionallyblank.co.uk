<p>Last time I wrote down what I aimed to do in a week, I only managed one part of the checklist. This time will be better.</p>
<p>This week I will be sorting several things out on this site as well as posting some tasty bits of code, let's see what's in store:</p>
<ul>
<li><abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> parser in PHP</li>
<li>Examples of things to do with XML</li>
<li>Cleaning up the mess of the latest new design</li>
<li>Another new design, this one with a bit of meaning</li>
<li>Fix the contact form</li>
<li><strong>Plugin frenzy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is anything you want to see, related to any of those points, then please leave a comment (as the contact form isn't working). I especially want to hear what the best Wordpress plugins that I haven't got are. Help me make my blog wonderful! What plugins do you use? What plugins do you wish you had? What plugins do you wish I had and would help you use my site? Let me know and I'll be looking into it soon.</p>
