<dt><a href="http://fadtastic.net">Fadtastic</a> reports that <a href="http://fadtastic.net/2007/04/04/leading-by-example/">only 94 (22%) of sites belonging to <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> are valid</a>.</dt>
<dd>Admittedly, having valid <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is not the most important thing in the world (even though <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/whereourstandardswentwrong">it should be</a>). However, for the W3C, the organisation who makes the standards, there should be some sort of leading by example. The fact that a quarter of the sites had no DOCTYPE declaration and 24% had more than 50 errors is worrying. Still, the article does show how the member sites are improving (slowly) over the years.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.josiahcole.com">Josiah Cole</a> rants about <a href="http://www.josiahcole.com/2007/02/14/a-webmasters-19-commandments/">what not to do when building a website</a> and gets it right all 19 times.</dt>
<dd>I particularly liked this article as I read it after seeing one of the worst websites I have ever come across today. The <a href="http://www.halo3.com">Halo 3</a> website fails on several of the points Josiah makes, including 2, 7, 9 and 14. The site makes you load a flash page which has no content on just so that you click a link to find out more which turns out to be a static HTML page. What an experience!</dd>

<dt><a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/04/wordpress-213-and-2010/">Wordpress 2.1.3 (and 2.0.10) have been released.</a></dt>
<dd>I upgraded today, it was painless and will keep my blog safe.</dd>

<dt>It's April 5th somewhere in the world, so <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com">Naked Day</a> is upon us.</dt>
<dd>See how nicely my content works, even without all the prettiness of my stylesheets. I think Unintentionally Blank looks good naked, what about you? Are you taking part?</dd>
