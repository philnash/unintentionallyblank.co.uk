<p>It looks like I have failed almost instantly in my first experience in blogging. I have disregarded <a href="http://urbansemiotic.com/2005/06/02/how-to-not-to-write-a-blog/">tips about blogging</a> that have been <a href="http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2003/12/08/gothamist_notes_1_what_not_to_do_when_you_blog.php">set down for years</a> and <em>not</em> to my surprise, found that only 4 people visited this site yesterday. If you are reading this, then I apologise for not posting anything for a whole week and I promise that I will rectify this situation starting from now.</p>
<p>I would love to set myself a proper goal for how often I am going to post, but I am so hectic at the moment that I cannot promise anything (especially nothing quite <a href="http://www.businessblogwire.com/2006/06/if_i_dont_keep_this_blogging_g_1.html">as severe as this</a>). However, you can certainly expect to see more posts appearing here in the near future.</p>
<p>In fact, I've just thought of something I need to write about, better finish off what I was supposed to be doing before I started writing this post so I can write another!</p>
