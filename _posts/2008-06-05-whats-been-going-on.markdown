<p>Wow! I haven't written here for ages! It's not like I don't have anything to say either, I have some views and thoughts on reset style sheets, accessibility for the hearing impaired, microformats and the length of time it takes to load a site, but I just haven't had the time to update!</p>

<p>What have I been doing then? Well, my job has been keeping me busy and recently we have launched two new sites, <a href="http://gfw.riverisland.com">River Island's Style Insider</a> and <a href="http://bigears.channel4.com">Big Brother's Big Ears</a>. Both were hard work and took a lot of effort from the whole team, but also include some of my first bits of Ruby on Rails. I'm quite proud of being part of <a href="http://www.mintdigital.com">the team</a> that has set both these sites up.</p>

<p>I almost lost my iMac the other week too, ended up re-installing OS X and crossing my fingers hoping that I didn't lose all my data. Thankfully, it's all still here, but that was a heart attack I didn't need.</p>

<p>So what now? Well, I'm going to start posting again, starting with an update to my style sheet switcher. Why? Firstly, it's very old code, back from when I knew hardly anything about javascript (though it works, can't take that away)! Also, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/06/05/style-switchers-are-back-ideas-examples-and-a-contest/">Smashing Magazine are having a style sheet switcher competition</a> and I fancy entering that too, who wouldn't want the prize on offer? There's two weeks to enter, so I better get cracking.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you do fancy keeping up with me off of the blog, I am on Twitter, so <a href="http://twitter.com/philnash">follow me</a>!</p>

<p>Bye for now.</p>
