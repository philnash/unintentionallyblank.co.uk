<p>Yesterday I found out that IBM were taking matters of accessibility to a new level by developing a <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/03/31/accessibility-browser-from-ibm-helps-blind-see-web-video/">browser that helps the blind and partially sighted</a> deal with mutlimedia content. Today I discover that <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">Amazon</a> is going to <a href="http://www.nfb.org/nfb/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=174">collaborate with the National Federation of the Blind</a> in order to "make more improvements for both our sighted customers and those customers who use screen access software to browse and shop the Internet."</p>

<p>As is normal with an announcement about accessibility for the blind, there is a <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/index.php/2007/amazoncom-to-go-accessible/">call to not ignore other disabled users</a>. I can't help but think that making inroads to accessibility for one group of less able users will benefit all groups, but I do agree that all should be taken into consideration. Let's hope that the Amazon developers and the <abbr title="National Federation of the Blind">NFB</abbr> work towards the more general goal of <em>accessibility for all</em>, it would seem  hypocritical and unfair of an organisation like the NFB to lock down the benefits to blind users only. Let's wait and see.</p>
