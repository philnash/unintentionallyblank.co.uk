<p>It was bad enough that I have found it difficult to update this blog recently, but when I discovered that <a href="http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/01/03/is-my-feed-working-properly/">I was only giving out a partial feed</a> I felt even worse that I couldn't fix it. There is plenty of debate over whether feeds are better as full or partial, but I can't stand only reading part of an article in my feed reader then having to visit the site. I subscribe to a feed so that I don't have to visit a site, save for commenting. Still, this is a long running issue and my opinion lies on the side that full feeds are king.</p>

<p>Given that my own site was violating my own beliefs, I had to fix it. Since I upgraded to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress 2.1</a> and found out that this is now intended behaviour when using the &lt;!--more--&gt; quicktag, though is also <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2582">subject to a debate</a>. Thankfully <a href="http://cavemonkey50.com">Ronald Heft</a> came to the rescue and has released <a href="http://cavemonkey50.com/code/full-feed/">Full Text Feed</a>, a plugin that exports the full article, whether you use the quicktag or not. This is now in action, so if you check <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ub">my feed</a>, you should now find the whole article available (can I take this opportunity to suggest subscribing too? I'll be writing loads of great stuff soon!)</p>

<h3>Not Satisfied!</h3>

<p>Since I was upgrading the Wordpress version, changing the design and fixing the feed problem, I decided not to stop there. Now at the bottom of each feed article you should find a bit more information about the post, including copyright, links to tag on <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, search on <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> and how many comments there are so far. I like all of this as it makes interaction with the site easier, giving more information as well as making it easier to react. This is thanks to <a href="http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/index.php">Ozh</a> and his <a href="http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-better-feed-rss/">Better Feed</a> plugin. It is highly customisable and allows you to put a footer on your posts including all the stuff I mentioned above. Ironically, one of it's features contradicts the two paragraphs above this one by allowing a 'Read more' link in your feed, but I turned that off pretty swiftly so as to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>All in all, my feed is now what I want it to be, full and loaded with extras so that you out there will read it. My thanks go to the plugin writers, let's just hope it works!</p>
