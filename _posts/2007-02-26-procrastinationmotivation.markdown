<p>I have never been any good at motivating myself. My university days were filled with lazing around followed by all night rushes to get the work in. Back in school a free period or breaktime before a lesson was enough time to finish the homework or revise for the test. My first teacher, when I was 5, said that I'd do very well if I could always have someone behind me telling me to work and she doesn't know how right she was.</p>

<p>In spite of this, I'm not doing bad for myself at the moment. I'm comfortable, but I think it may be too comfortable. You may have noticed a drop in the posting towards the end of last week and you probably assumed that I was working on something to blog about or busying myself doing something else important. I wasn't.</p>

<h3>Staring At The Screen</h3>

<p>Sure, I was at my computer, I was checking my emails, reading the feeds I subscribe to, <em>thinking</em> about the things I wanted to do. I never got around to doing any of them and this is now starting to annoy me.</p>

<p>I use the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/ig?hl=en">Google personalised homepage</a> and have added the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/ig/directory?hl=en&amp;url=http://www.google.com/ig/modules/todo.xml&amp;synd=ig">To-Do list</a> to my main tab, but it isn't helping, it currently catalogues a list of things I still haven't done.</p>

<h3>Turning It Around</h3>

<p>What's the point of a to-do list if it doesn't encourage you to do things? This is the idea of <a href="http://www.emomsathome.com/">Wendy's</a> <a href="http://emomsathome.com/blog/2007/02/05/monday-motivation-i-need-some-leverage/">Motivation Monday</a>. Post a list of things you need to do and, if you're feeling brave, set a penalty for not completing the tasks. I found this through <a href="http://www.casualkeystrokes.com">Char</a> and her <a href="http://casualkeystrokes.com/tackling-monday-head-on/">first go at this</a> and the crossed off aims show how hard this is. Not that it is not worth it, of course, in fact a failure or two should only strengthen the resolve and encourage you to try harder next time.</p>

<p>I don't want to do it exactly like Wendy, not just because, as I type this, there is only 19 minutes left of Monday and challenging myself to anything more than finish this post and go to bed would be ridiculous. I have a few big ideas that I need to schedule for myself, and maybe a bit of self imposed pressure will help. I don't really have the means to promise to pay out on failure of any task, however I do expect anyone who has read this to check up on me and post disapproving comments if I do miss out. There's nothing worse than disappointing people, so make me feel really bad if I don't manage this, please!</p>

<h3>The Week's Aims</h3>

<ul>
<li>Tomorrow I must have a go at throwing some code together and putting something into <a href="http://technosailor.com">Aaron Brazell's</a> <a href="http://technosailor.com/wordpress-custom-fields-contest/">Wordpress custom fields contest</a>. I have had a killer idea for ages and just not done anything about it, Wednesday is the deadline and if I miss this I will kick myself for losing the chance to prove to myself, as well as others, what I am capable of.</li>
<li>I am going to come up with an up to date <abbr title="Curiculum Vitae">CV</abbr> and apply for some jobs. I am getting too comfortable in my current job and it's not what I want to be doing, so I've got to get out of the comfort zone and into the real world. Got to do this on Wednesday.</li>
<li>I am going to redesign <a href="http://www.hammervsthesnake.co.uk">my band's</a> site, including integrating it into a proper blogging solution. For far too long we have relied on importing a blogger feed and now I know what I'm doing with <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> I am going to break out of the easy option. My aim is to be nearly there with a design and implementation by the end of the week.</li>
</ul>

<p>So now you know what my aims are, can you help to keep me focused? Do you have a problem motivating yourself or a better solution than this?</p>

<p>You know what is ironic? I could have been doing any of the above instead of writing this. Don't worry, I'll motivate myself tomorrow.</p>
