<p>Ok, I've said all along it's been a slow process tweaking and playing with my design, but it's really starting to drag on now. So to keep you interested I thought I might let you have a quick peek at it. Sorry for the delay!</p>

<p>Yeah, light blues, gradients and purple bits! Exciting stuff. There shouldn't be too much more banging of my head against various walls, there are only the fiddly bits left to do now (comments, archives, sidebar, etc), though the amount of time it's taken me to decide on the format of the date has been rather surprising!</p>
<p>Anyway, what do you think? Does it look like an improvement on what you see before you now? Oh, and unlike <a href="http://nyssajbrown.net/blog/2006/10/21/over-tweaking-causes-headaches/">Nyssa</a>, I won't be completely <a href="http://nyssajbrown.net/blog/2006/10/29/new-theme/">changing my mind</a>! Though I really like her new theme, I hope my effort will stand up next to hers!</p>
